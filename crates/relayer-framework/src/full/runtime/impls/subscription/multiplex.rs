/**
   Multiplex the incoming [`Stream`] provided by an underlying [`Subscription`]
   into multiple outgoing [`Stream`]s through a background task. This is
   an auto trait implemented by all runtime contexts that implement
   [`HasSpawner`], [`HasMutex`], [`CanCreateChannels`], [`CanUseChannels`],
   and [`CanStreamReceiver`].

   This can be used to improve the efficiency of naive subscriptions created from
   [`CanCreateClosureSubscription`](crate::base::runtime::impls::subscription::closure::CanCreateClosureSubscription).
   For example, one can first create a subscription closure that establishes
   new network connection each time `subscribe` is called. The subscription
   closure is then passed to [`multiplex_subscription`](Self::multiplex_subscription),
   which would return a wrapped subscription which would only create one
   network connection at a time.

   The multiplexed subscription also attempts to recover by calling the
   [`subscribe`](Subscription::subscribe) method of the underlying subsciption
   again, if a given [`Stream`] terminates. This would allow for auto recovery
   from underlying errors such as network disconnection. The multiplexed
   subscription would only terminate if the underlying
   [`subscribe`](Subscription::subscribe) returns `None`.

   The streams returned from the [`subscribe`](Subscription::subscribe) of
   the multiplexed subscription will automatically resume streaming from
   a new underlying stream, if the original underlying stream is terminated.
   However, since a consumer cannot know if a [`Subscription`] implementation
   is multiplexed or not, it should always retry calling
   [`subscribe`](Subscription::subscribe) in case a [`Stream`] ends.

/**
   A packet event relayer that performs packet relaying based on chain events
   related to IBC packets.

   The implementation of `PacketEventRelayer` for the [`SourceTarget`] is
   different from the [`DestinationTarget`]. This is because the packet
   relaying operations from the source chain is different from the target chain.

   When relaying events from the source chain, the packet event relayer is
   mostly interested in the `SendPacket` event, so that it can relay a
   `RecvPacket` message to the destination chain, or a `TimeoutPacket` message
   to the source chain.

   When relaying events from the destination chain, the packet event relayer
   is mostly interested in the `WriteAcknowledgement` event, so that it can
   relay a `AckPacket` message to the source chain.

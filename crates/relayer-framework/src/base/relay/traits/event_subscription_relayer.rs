/**
   An event subscription relayer performs event relaying based on a given
   [`Subscription`](HasSubscriptionType::Subscription) of events.

   The relayer performs the relaying by subscribing to the event subscription,
   and then delegate the relaying of individual events to [`CanRelayEvent`].

   Different implementation of [`EventSubscriptionRelayer`] may employ
   different strategies of relaying multiple events. For example,
   [`SequentialEventSubscriptionRelayer`] relays only one packet at a time,
   while [`ConcurrentEventSubscriptionRelayer`] allows relaying of multiple
   events concurrently.

   Note that the implementation of this relayer is _concurrent_ but
   _not parallel_. This is because it uses [`StreamExt::for_each_concurrent`]
   for multiplexing between multiple concurrent executions. This means that
   if one of the event relayer is blocked synchronously, it may also block the
   execution of other relayers.

   Although there is the limitation of non-parallelism,
   [`ConcurrentEventSubscriptionRelayer`] is useful in use cases where parallel
   executions are _not_ possible, such as inside deterministic tests or inside
   single-threaded environments. In such cases, it would still be possible to
   have concurrent execution of event relaying.

//! A HashMap<Height, ChainState> is used to represent the State of the
//! chain.
//! The current_state is the ChainState at all Heights, up to the latest Height.
//! The consensus_states is a HashMap<ClientId, HashMap<Height, ChainState>>.
//! This is used to check the state of a specific client, at a
//! specific height.
//! Usually the consensus_states would use the root hashes of a Merle Tree,
//! but since the MockChain is used for testing and will have a small number
//! of states, the whole state is used. This avoids needing to implement
//! Merkle Trees and Proofs.

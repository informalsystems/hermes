   Provides a packet lock mutex for packet relayers to coordinate and avoid
   relaying the same packet at the same time.

   Before a packet relayer starts relaying, it should try and acquire a
   [`PacketLock`](Self::PacketLock) from the relay context. The packet lock
   would act as a mutex guard and stays active for its lifetime duration.
   During this period, acquiring the packet lock for another packet would fail,
   and this would signal to other packet relayers to skip relaying the given
   packet.

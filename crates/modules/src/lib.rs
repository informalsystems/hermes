//! This library implements the InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) protocol in Rust. IBC is
//! a distributed protocol that enables communication between distinct sovereign blockchains.
//! Loose analogies may be drawn between the IBC protocol and the TCP/UDP protocols that enable
//! communication over the internet via packet streaming. Indeed, IBC also encodes the notion of
//! ordered and unordered packet streams.
//!
//! The layout of this crate mirrors the classification of the [Interchain
//! Standards][ics-standards]. The classification consists of [Core][core], [Clients][clients],
//! [Applications][applications], and [Relayer][relayer].
//!
//! `Core` consists of the designs and logic pertaining to the transport, authentication, and
//! ordering layers of the IBC protocol, the fundamental pieces.
//!
//! `Clients` consists of implementations of client verification algorithms (following the base
//! client interface that is defined in `Core`) for specific types of chains. A chain uses these
//! verification algorithms to verify the state of remote chains.
//!
//! `Applications` consists of various packet encoding and processing semantics which underpin the
//! various types of transactions that users can perform on any IBC-compliant chain.
//!
//! `Relayer` contains utilities for testing the `ibc` crate against the [Hermes IBC relayer][relayer-repo]. It acts
//! as scaffolding for gluing the `ibc` crate with Hermes for testing purposes.

# release.sh will hopefully allow us to publish all of the necessary crates in
# this repo in the right order, along with a few checks and balances to try to
# avoid mistakes. It is assumed that only one person will be releasing all
# crates at the same time.
#
# For each crate, it will:
# 1. Run `cargo publish --dry-run` for that crate
# 2. List all files in the package with `cargo package --list`
# 3. Prompt the user as to whether to publish or not
# 4. Publish the package with `cargo publish` (no dry run)
#
# It has a default set of crates it will publish, which can be overridden by
# way of command line arguments:
#
#   # Release all packages, prompting for each package as to whether to publish
#   ./release.sh
#
#   # Just release the ibc-proto and ibc crates, but nothing else
#   ./release.sh ibc-proto ibc
#
# Once it publishes a crate, it will create a file at
# /tmp/ibc-rs-release/${TODAY}/${CRATE}, where ${TODAY} is today's date
# and ${CRATE} is the name of the crate that was successfully published.
#
# Prior to publishing a crate, it checks whether this file is present before
# attempting to publish it. If it's present, it will ask if you really want to
# publish it again. Of course, this is pretty dumb, and doesn't cater for
# instances where multiple people could publish the crates on the same day, and
# instances where someone reboots their machine or wipes their /tmp folder
# between runs.

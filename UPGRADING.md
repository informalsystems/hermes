# Upgrading Hermes to a newer version

## v1.6.0

> These instructions assume that you are running Hermes v1.5.0 or newer.
> If you are running an older version, please refer to the upgrading instructions
> for the older release candidates in reverse chronological order to update to
> v1.5.0 first and then follow these instructions.

- The `websocket_addr` configuration option has been removed in favour of the new `event_source` setting.

  In every chain configuration section, replace the `websocket_addr = 'WS_URL'` setting with:

  ```toml
  event_source = { mode = 'push', url = '$WS_URL', batch_delay = '200ms' }
  ```

  The `batch_delay` option can be used to determine how long the WebSocket
  event source should wait before emitting an event batch after having received the first
  event for the current height. If the setting is too high, the event source will
  have to wait for the next `NewBlock` event until it can emit the batch.
  If the setting is too low, the event batch might be emitted before all events
  for the latest height have been received, causing more delays until all events
  are processed. 500ms is a conservative but fairly safe default. Try lowering
  if you believe Hermes is not relaying packets fast enough for you.

## v1.5.0

> These instructions assume that you are running Hermes v1.0.0 or newer.
> If you are running an older version, please refer to the upgrading instructions
> for the older release candidates in reverse chronological order to update to
> v1.0.0 first and then follow these instructions.

- The `unbonding_period` chain setting was removed. That setting was only meant
  to be used for CCV consumer chains when there was no way to query their unbonding
  period. Instead, for CCV consumer chains, just set the new `ccv_consumer_chain`
  chain setting to `true` to identify that chain as a consumer chain.

- The following metrics now have a `_total` suffix:
  - `client_updates_submitted` -> `client_updates_submitted_total`
  - `total_messages_submitted` -> `messages_submitted_total`
  - `receive_packets_confirmed` -> `receive_packets_confirmed_total`
  - `acknowledgment_packets_confirmed` -> `acknowledgment_packets_confirmed_total`
  - `timeout_packets_confirmed_total` -> `timeout_packets_confirmed_total`

## v1.0.0

> These instructions assume that you are running Hermes v1.0.0-rc.2.
> If you are running an older version, please refer to the upgrading instructions
> for the older release candidates in reverse chronological order to update to
> v1.0.0-rc.2 first and then follow these instructions.

This release includes multiple changes related to telemetry:
- Renamed the following metrics:
  * `ibc_client_updates` to `client_updates_submitted`
  * `ibc_client_misbehaviours ` to `client_misbehaviours_submitted`
  * `ibc_receive_packets` to `receive_packets_confirmed`
  * `ibc_acknowledgment_packets ` to `acknowledgment_packets_confirmed`
  * `ibc_timeout_packets ` to `timeout_packets_confirmed`
  * `cache_hits` to `queries_cache_hits`
  * `msg_num` to `total_messages_submitted`
  * `send_packet_count` to `send_packet_events`
  * `acknowledgement_count` to `acknowledgement_events`
  * `cleared_send_packet_count` to `cleared_send_packet_events`
  * `cleared_acknowledgment_count` to `cleared_acknowledgment_events`
- Added the following metric:
  * `timeout_events`

For more details, please check out the [new section that was added to guide][telemetry-guide],
which describes how the new metrics can be used to observe both the current state of
the relayer and the networks it is connected to.

## v1.0.0-rc.2

This release is backward compatible with Hermes v1.0.0-rc.1 ðŸŽ‰


## v1.0.0-rc.1

> These instructions assume that you are running Hermes v1.0.0-rc.0.
> If you are running an older version, please refer the corresponding
> in reverse chronological order to update to v1.0.0-rc.0 first and then
> follow these instructions.

### Default value of `tx_confirmation` setting has changed

The default value of the configuration `tx_confirmation`
in Hermes `config.toml` has been changed from `true` to `false`.

If you previously did not specify a value for this setting, you will
have to set `tx_confirmation = true` in `config.toml` under
the `[mode.packets]` section.

### All `tx raw` subcommands were moved to the `tx` namespace

The `raw` prefix was removed from all the commands listed below,
they are now available directly under the `tx` namespace:

- `hermes tx chan-close-confirm`
- `hermes tx chan-close-init`
- `hermes tx chan-open-ack`
- `hermes tx chan-open-confirm`
- `hermes tx chan-open-init`
- `hermes tx chan-open-try`
- `hermes tx conn-ack`
- `hermes tx conn-confirm`
- `hermes tx conn-init`
- `hermes tx conn-try`
- `hermes tx create-client`
- `hermes tx ft-transfer`
- `hermes tx packet-ack`
- `hermes tx packet-recv`
- `hermes tx update-client`
- `hermes tx upgrade-chain`
- `hermes tx upgrade-client`
- `hermes tx upgrade-clients`

### Rename `--a-` and `--b-` prefixes in `hermes tx` subcommands to `--src-` and `--dst-`

All commands under the `tx` namespace, with the exception of `tx upgrade-chain`, now use
`--src-` and `--dst` prefix for flags names instead of `--a-` and `--b-`.

The `tx upgrade-chain` command now uses `--reference-` and `--host-` prefixes.

Please check the commands help or [ADR 010][adr-010] for the full updated list of commands.

## v1.0.0-rc.0

> These instructions assume that you are running Hermes v0.15.0.
> If you are running an older version, please refer the corresponding
> in reverse chronological order to update to v0.15.0 first and then
> follow these instructions.

### Commands now use flags instead of positional arguments

From this version forward, all Hermes commands now use flags exclusively instead
of positional arguments.

For example, in version 0.15.0 the `create client` command would be invoked
as follows to create a client on host chain `ibc-0` which tracks reference chain `ibc-1`:

```
$ hermes create client ibc-0 ibc-1
````

As of version 1.0.0-rc.0, the command must now be invoked as follows, using flags instead of
positional arguments:

```
$ hermes create client --host-chain ibc-0 --reference-chain ibc-1
```

Please [consult the ADR][adr-010] which describes the new CLI flags for all commands.

### The `keys restore` command has been merged into `keys add`

The `keys restore` command has been merged into the existing `keys add` command.

Restoring a key now takes a file containing the mnemonic as input instead of directly taking the mnemonic.

Additionally, the flag to specify the key name for the CLI command `keys add` has been changed from `--nname` to `--key-name`.

As of version 1.0.0-rc.0, one must use the `keys add` command as follows in order
to restore a key from a mnemonic file instead of the `keys restore` command:

```
$ hermes keys add -chain <CHAIN_ID> --mnemonic-file <MNEMONIC_FILE>
```

### The `gas_adjustment` setting has been deprecated in favor of `gas_multiplier`

The `gas_adjustment` setting has been deprecated in favor of new `gas_multiplier` setting.

If you were using the `gas_adjustment` setting, please remove it from the
chain configurations and use the `gas_multiplier` setting instead.

Whereas the `gas_adjustment` setting would specify a percentage by which to increase
the estimated gas amount before broadcasting a transaction (eg. a value of 0.1
would increase the gas by 10%), the `gas_multiplier` simply specifies by
which amount to multiply the estimated gas before sending a transaction.

For example, if the chain configuration used `gas_adjustment = 0.1` to increase
the estimated gas amount by 10%, you must now use `gas_multiplier = 1.1`.

### Two `query packet` commands have been renamed

The `query packet unreceived-packets` has been renamed to `query packet pending-sends` to better
reflect its behavior.

The `query packet unreceived-acks` has been renamed to `query packet pending-acks` for consistency.

## v0.15.0

No breaking changes from v0.14.1.

## v0.14.1

No breaking changes from v0.14.0.

## v0.14.0

This release notably features a new [`query packet pending`][pending] command to
list outstanding packet commitments that are either unreceived or pending
acknowledgement at both ends of a channel.

The `create channel` command now requires an existing client and connection,
unless the `--new-client-connection` flag is provided.
Please [refer to the guide][create-channel] for more information.

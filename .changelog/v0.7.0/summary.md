This release of Hermes is the first to be compatible with the development version of Cosmos SDK 0.43.
Hermes 0.7.0 also improves the performance and reliability of the relayer, notably by waiting asynchronously for transactions to be confirmed.
Additionnally, Hermes now includes a REST server which exposes the relayer's internal state over HTTP.

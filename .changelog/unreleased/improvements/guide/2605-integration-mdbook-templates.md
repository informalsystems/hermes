- Integration with `mdbook` templates
  ([#2605](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/2605))
- New script `auto_gen_templates.sh` to automatically generate templates files and warns users when one of them is updated. It is the responsibility of the users to update the guide when a template file is updated.
- New CI job to check that every template is up-to-date.

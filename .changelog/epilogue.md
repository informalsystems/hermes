## v0.6.1
*July 22nd, 2021*

This minor release mainly improves the reliability of the relayer
by ensuring that pending packets are cleared on start,
and that Hermes can recover from the WebSocket subscriptions
being closed under its feet by Tendermint.

Upgrading from version `0.6.0` to `0.6.1` requires no explicit steps.

> **WARNING:** Due to a regression ([#1229]), the `upgrade client`,
> `tx raw upgrade-clients`, and `tx raw upgrade-chain` commands have
> been temporarily disabled in this version.
> These commands will be re-enabled in the next version.

### FEATURES

## v0.6.0
*July 12th, 2021*


Many thanks to Fraccaroli Gianmarco (@Fraccaman) for helping us improve the
reliability of Hermes ([#697]).

This release includes two major features to Hermes: (1) support for reloading
the chains from the configuration file at runtime, and (2) a filtering mechanism
to restrict Hermes activity based on predefined parameters (e.g., packet relaying
on certain ports and channels exclusively, and ignoring activity for clients
that have non-standard trust threshold).

In addition to these two, we have also added a health checkup mechanism, plus new
`config validate` and `query channel ends` CLIs.

### Upgrading from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0

When upgrading from Hermes v0.5.0 to v0.6.0, the most important
point to watch out for is the configuration file.
The Hermes config.toml configuration file has went through a few revisions,
with the changes described below.

#### Added inline documentation for all options.

Please have a look around the [config.toml](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/v0.6.0/config.toml) directly.

#### Added a packet filtering mechanism based on channel/port identifiers

This feature will restrict the channels on which Hermes relays packets.
There are two new options in the configuration file:

1. A global `filter` parameter to enable or disable filtering globally.
2. A per-chain `.filters` option that expects a `policy` (either `allow` or
   `deny`) plus a list of channel and
   port identifiers. If policy is `allow`, then packet relaying will be restricted to this
   list for the corresponding chain. If the policy is `deny`, then any packets
   from this list will be ignored.

#### Added filtering based on client state

The global `filter` option additionally enables filtering of all activities
based on client state trust threshold. If enabled, Hermes will ignore all
activity for clients that have a trust threshold different than `1/3`.

#### Added a packet clearing configuration option

This will enable the parametrization of the frequency
at which Hermes will clear pending packets. This is a global option, called
`clear_packets_interval`, which applies to all chains in the configuration.


The full list of changes is described below.

### FEATURES

- [ibc-relayer]
  - The chains configuration can be reloaded by sending the Hermes process a `SIGHUP` signal ([#1117])
  - Added support for filtering based on client state trust threshold ([#1165])

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Added `config validate` CLI to Hermes ([#600])
  - Added filtering capability to deny or allow for specific channels ([#1140], [#1141], [#69])
  - Added basic channel filter ([#1140])
  - Added `query channel ends` CLI command ([#1062])
  - Added a health checkup mechanism for Hermes ([#697, #1057])

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Update to `tendermint-rs` v0.20.0 ([#1125])
- Add inline documentation to config.toml ([#1127])

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Hermes will now clear pending packets at a configurable interval ([#1124])

### BUG FIXES

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Fix for schedule refreshing bug ([#1143])

## v0.5.0
*June 22nd, 2021*

This release brings a few features, and several improvements and bug fixes to the Hermes
relayer, notably the capability for Hermes to complete IBC connection handshakes when
it detects that one has been initialized, as well as the ability to detect chain
impersonation attacks and to dynamically estimate the gas needed to submit
a transaction.

Moreover, the overall reliability and availability of the relayer has also been improved
substantially by switching over to `tx_broadcast_sync` for submitting transactions.

### FEATURES

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Add `--hd-path` option to `keys restore` and `keys add` commands to specify
    derivation path when importing keys ([#1049])

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Event-based handshake completion for IBC connections ([#821])
  - Enable TLS support for gRPC client ([#877])

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Minor log output improvements: color enabled, reduced redundant information ([#1100])

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Update the on-chain IBC client with supporting headers when light client verification
    performs bisection when verifying a header for a client update or a misbehaviour detection ([#673])
  - Add mitigation for chain impersonation attacks ([#1038])
  - Determine gas fee dynamically per transaction ([#930])
  - Submit transactions with `broadcast_tx_sync` and keep track of account sequences ([#986])

### BUG FIXES

- [gaiad-manager]
  - Removed the testnet command as not all networks support it ([#1050])
  - Update for compatibility with Hermes's new `--hd-path` option

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Fix bug where channels were left partially open after `channel create` ([#1064])
  - Prevent account sequence mismatch errors in many cases ([#919], [#978])
  - Prevent timeouts when submitting transactins ([#977])

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Removed `--coin-type` option from `keys restore` command. Use `--hd-path` instead ([#1049])

## v0.4.0
*June 3rd, 2021*

- This release of Hermes features an internal [telemetry service][telemetry]
  which can export metrics about the relayer to Prometheus.
- A new [relaying strategy][strategy] is now available, which enables Hermes to
  complete channel handshakes in an event-based fashion.
- Hermes now checks if another relayer may have already processed a packet event,
  and will not attempt to process it itself, which improves performance.
- The startup time of the relayer has been substantially improved.
- The `start-multi` command has been promoted to `start`, which means
  that the worker-based relayer is not experimental anymore.
- A regression where Hermes would not recover after a node went down and up again was fixed.

## v0.0.2

*August 1, 2020*

This release is focused on updating the query system from amino to protobuf,
implementing a few queries from the CLI, and establishing an initial testing framework
that will support multiple chain types.

It does not target a stable release of Cosmos-SDK chains, but is tracking
the latest state of development towards the Cosmos-SDK Stargate release.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- [ibc|ibc-relayer] Refactor queries, paths, and Chain trait to reduce code and use
  protobuf instead of Amino.
        [\#152](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/152),
        [\#174](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/174),
        [\#155](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/155)
- [repo] Moved relayer/cli to relayer-cli, relayer/relay to relayer. [\#183](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/183)

### FEATURES:

- [ibc-relayer] Query connections given client id. [\#169](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/169)
- [ibc-relayer] Query connection given connection id. [\#136](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/136)
- [ibc-relayer] Query channel given channel id and port [\#163](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/163)
- [spec] Channel closing datagrams in TLA+ [\#141](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/141)

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- [ci] Framework (scripts and Github Actions) for integration testing the relayer queries against
    the Cosmos-SDK's `simd` binary with prepopulated IBC state in the genesis
        [\#140](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/140),
        [\#184](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/184)
- [ibc-relayer|ibc] Implemented better Raw type handling. [\#156](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/156)
- [repo] Add rust-toolchain file. [\#154](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/154)

### BUG FIXES:

- [ibc] Fixed the identifiers limits according to updated ics spec. [\#189](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/189)
- [ibc/relayer] Remove some warnings triggered during compilation due to dependency specification. [\#132](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/132)
- [ibc] Fix nightly runs. [\#161](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/161)
- [repo] Fix for incomplete licence terms. [\#153](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/153)

## 0.0.1

*July 1st, 2020*

This is the initial prototype release of an IBC relayer and TLA+ specifications.
There are no compatibility guarantees until v0.1.0.

Includes:

- Configuration file definition and validation
- Client state, consensus state, connection, channel queries.
    - Note: deserialization is unimplemented as it has dependency on migration to protobuf for ABCI queries
- Per chain light clients threads are created and headers are periodically retrieved and verified.
- Per chain IBC event monitor threads are spawned and main event handler that receives them.
    - Note: the event handler just displays the events.
- IBC Modules partial implementation for datastructures, messages and queries.
- Some English and TLA+ specifications for Connection & Channel Handshake as well as naive relayer algorithm.

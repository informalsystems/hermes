This release notably speeds up the startup time of Hermes,
adds options to the `create client` command to customize the client parameters,
makes the deposit denomination configurable in `tx raw upgrade-chain` via a new `--denom` flag,
and adds a `completions` CLI command to generate shell auto-completion scripts.

🎉 **Hermes v1.5.0** is here, packed with a slew of exciting updates, including
breaking changes💥, brand-new features🎁, performance enhancements🚀, and
sweeping improvements✨. 

The one breaking change is the removal of the `unbonding_period` setting
from the chain configuration. This is now replaced by a fresh
`ccv_consumer_chain` setting for Cross-Chain Validation (CCV) consumer chains. 

Also, Hermes has strengthened its misbehavior detection. With the
`mode.misbehaviour.enabled` setting enabled (now the case by default)
the relayer was already closely monitoring on-chain client updates,
comparing submitted headers with those fetched from its RPC node.
In the event of any discrepancy, Hermes would report the misbehaviour
to the chain hosting the IBC client. As of this version,
Hermes will also report the misbehaviour evidence to the reference chain.

This version rolls out a string of performance enhancements. Event batches
are now delivered after a configurable delay, greatly trimming down latency
when relaying, particularly on high-traffic channels. This can be adjusted
using the `batch_delay` setting in the per-chain configuration. Plus, packet
acknowledgments are only queried when there are packet commitments on the
counterparty, resulting in a major speed boost for packet clearing and
on-start scanning! 🚀

In addition, the `trusted_node` setting can now specify whether the full node
Hermes connects to is trusted or not. If untrusted, the light client will
verify headers included in the `ClientUpdate` message.
However, a word of caution: configuring the full node as trusted may cut
down latency but could risk sending invalid client updates to the chain. Use wisely! ⚠️

Our [Hermes guide](https://hermes.informal.systems/) has been re-organized a bit,
now featuring a new [*Performance Tuning*][perf-guide] page that details the
settings for optimizing the performance of the relayer.

For all the debuggers out there, Hermes now equips a new `--debug` global
flag with several selectable values, and two bonus flags, `--archive-address`
and `--restart-height` that enable a client update following a genesis restart
without an IBC upgrade proposal.

When it comes to telemetry, the destination chain is now added to the labels of
the confirmed packet metrics.

Take note that some metrics now have the suffix `_total`. If you're using a running a
Grafana dashboard or any other tool relying on the metric names or labels, an update might be needed.
The [corresponding page in the guide][telemetry-guide] reflects the new metric names and
labels for your convenience.

There's also a fresh configuration option to specify the directory used for the
keyring store.

From this version onwards, multi-platform (arm64 and amd64) images will be
distributed both on Docker Hub and the GitHub Content Repository.

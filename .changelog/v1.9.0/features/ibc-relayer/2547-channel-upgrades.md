  - Add support for upgrading channels, as per the [ICS 004 specification](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics/UPGRADES.md) ([#3228](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/2547))
    This feature allows chains to upgrade an existing channel to take advantage of new features without having to create a new channel, thus preserving all existing packet state processed on the channel. For example, a channel could now be upgraded to enable the [ICS 029 fee middleware](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/middleware/ics29-fee/overview), allowing relayer operators on that channel to receive fees each time they relay an incentivized packet.

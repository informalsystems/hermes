name: Tracking Issue
about: Create a meta issue for tracking more granular tasks

---

<!-- 
  _Note_: Tracking issues are meta-level issues meant to capture smaller units 
  of work that contribute to a larger initiative. As such, tracking issues should
  always be tagged with either the 'tracking' label or the 'okr' label. 
  
  The 'okr' label should be applied when the tracking issue maps directly with a quarterly
  OKR activity. Additionally, the OKR-labeled issue should also be linked to in the 
  Workflow Explorer. 

  Not all tracking issues will map with OKRs. Such issues should thus be tagged with 
  the 'tracking' label.

/*!
    A quick demo of how a test with full setup can be written.

    ```rust
    # use ibc_relayer_test::prelude::*;

    #[test]
    pub fn example_test() -> Result<(), Error> {
        run_binary_channel_test(&ExampleTest)
    }

    pub struct ExampleTest;

    impl TestOverrides for ExampleTest {}

    impl BinaryChannelTest for ExampleTest {
        fn run<ChainA: ChainHandle, ChainB: ChainHandle>(
            &self,
            _config: &TestConfig,
            _chains: &ConnectedChains<ChainA, ChainB>,
            _channel: &ConnectedChannel<ChainA, ChainB>,
        ) -> Result<(), Error> {
            suspend()
        }
    }
    ```

    We first define an empty struct [`ExampleTest`] to represent our test case.
    We then implement the
    [`BinaryChannelTest`](crate::framework::binary::channel::BinaryChannelTest)
    trait so that the test framework sets up the relayer with two chains
    running together with connected channels.

    Inside our test, we simply call the [`suspend`](crate::suspend) function to
    suspend the test indefinitely. While this means that the test would never
    pass, we can use this as a starting point to do _manual testing_ with the
    chains that have been setup by the test, and figure out how to continue
    writing our test.

    We also implement [`TestOverrides`] for [`ExampleTest`] with an empty body.
    The [`TestOverrides`] trait allows us to override some behavior of the
    test case by implement methods that override the default behavior.

    Finally, we define the `example_test` function with the `#[test]` pragma
    as the entry point for Rust to execute the test. We call the runner function
    [`run_binary_channel_test`](crate::framework::binary::channel::run_binary_channel_test),
    which accepts a reference to any struct implementing
    [`BinaryChannelTest`](crate::framework::binary::channel::BinaryChannelTest)
    and run the test for us.

    By convention, the tests written are placed in the [`tests`](crate::tests)
    module. We can then run the test on the command line such as follows:

    ```bash
    RUST_LOG=info RUST_BACKTRACE=1 \
        cargo test -p ibc-relayer-test --features example -- --test-threads=1 \
        example_test
    ```

    We use the environment variables `RUST_LOG` to control the log level,
    and `RUST_BACKTRACE` to display backtrace when errors occurred.
    The test flag `--test-threads=1` is set so that Rust do not run multiple
    tests in parallel, as it can make it difficult to follow the logs.
    See [TestConfig](crate::types::config::TestConfig) for more information
    about configuring how the tests should be run.

    For this example, we disable the test from running by default, since
    it uses [`suspend`] and is never going to pass. Here we explicitly pass
    `--features example` so that the `example` feature is activated and this
    test will run. Finally we specify the name of the test, which in our case
    is `example_test`, so that only that test is being run.

    After starting the test, we may see the logs such as following shown:

    ```text
    INFO ibc_relayer_test: starting test with test config: TestConfig { chain_command_path: "gaiad", chain_store_dir: "/path/to/data/test-2970732058", hang_on_fail: false }
    INFO ibc_relayer_test: started new chain ibc-alpha-43044935 at with home path /path/to/data/test-2970732058/ibc-alpha-43044935 and RPC address http://localhost:56723.
    INFO ibc_relayer_test: user wallet for chain ibc-alpha-43044935 - id: user1-34693377, address: cosmos1yyld4h2wwqz57dsqz4tmrmrsw6qw7unve884y5
    INFO ibc_relayer_test: you can manually interact with the chain using commands starting with: gaiad --home '/path/to/data/test-2970732058/ibc-alpha-43044935' --node http://localhost:56723
    ...
    INFO ibc_relayer_test: written hermes config.toml to /path/to/data/test-2970732058/config-61e5e82f.toml
    ...
    WARN ibc_relayer_test: suspending the test indefinitely. you can still interact with any spawned chains and relayers
    ```

    You can find in the logs information about how to manually interact with
    the chains that have been setup by the test. Near the last line of the
    logs, you can also find a warning that states that the test have been
    suspended indefinitely. We can also notice that the chains are created
    with random IDs and listening on random ports.

    Using the log information, we can for example use `gaiad` to query for
    the balance of the accounts created by the test by running something like:

    ```bash
    $ gaiad --home '/path/to/data/test-2970732058/ibc-alpha-43044935' \
        --node http://localhost:56723 query bank balances \
        cosmos1yyld4h2wwqz57dsqz4tmrmrsw6qw7unve884y5
    balances:
    - amount: "4397308370871"
    denom: coin42984fae
    - amount: "4397308370871"
    denom: stake
    pagination:
    next_key: null
    total: "0"
    ```

    We can also see the data and configuration files generated in the absolute
    path shown in the log, which looks something like `/path/to/data/test-2970732058`.
    The sub-directory `test-2970732058` is randomly generated at the beginning
    of a test case, so that all data related to that test case belongs to the
    same directory.

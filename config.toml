# If the global 'filter' option is set to 'true' and this section is missing then no filtering is performed for this chain.
# Only packet filtering based on channel identifier can be specified.

# 1. `policy` - one of two types are supported:
#       - 'allow': permit relaying _only on_ the port/channel id in the list below,
#       - 'deny': permit relaying on any channel _except for_ the list below.
# 2. `list` - the list of channels specified by the port and channel identifiers.
#
# Example configuration of a channel filter, denying packet relaying on channel with port ID 'transfer' and channel ID 'channel-0':
#
# [chains.packet_filter]
# policy = 'deny'
# list = [
#   ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
# ]

# Specify that the transaction fees should be payed from this fee granter's account.
# Optional. If unspecified (the default behavior), then no fee granter is used, and
# the account specified in `key_name` will pay the tx fees for all transactions
# submitted to this chain.

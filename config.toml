# Specify the store prefix used by the on-chain IBC modules. Required

# Gas Parameters
# 
# The term 'gas' is used to denote the amount of computation needed to execute
# and validate a transaction on-chain. It can be thought of as fuel that gets 
# spent in order to power the on-chain execution of a transaction.
#
# Hermes attempts to simulate how much gas a transaction will expend on its 
# target chain. From that, it calculates the cost of that gas by multiplying the
# amount of estimated gas by the `gas_multiplier` and the `gas_price`
# (estimated gas * `gas_multiplier` * `gas_price`) in order to compute the 
# total fee to be deducted from the relayer's wallet.
# 
# The `simulate_tx` operation does not always correctly estimate the appropriate
# amount of gas that a transaction requires. In those cases when the operation 
# fails, Hermes will attempt to submit the transaction using the specified 
# `default_gas` and `max_gas` parameters. In the case that a transaction would 
# require more than `max_gas`, it doesn't get submitted and a 
# `TxSimulateGasEstimateExceeded` error is returned.

# Specify the default amount of gas to be used in case the tx simulation fails,
# and Hermes cannot estimate the amount of gas needed.
# Default: 100 000
default_gas = 100000

# Specify the maximum amount of gas to be used as the gas limit for a transaction.
# If `default_gas` is unspecified, then `max_gas` will be used as `default_gas`.
# Default: 400 000
max_gas = 400000

# Specify the price per gas used of the fee to submit a transaction and
# the denomination of the fee. 
# 
# The specified gas price should always be greater or equal to the `min-gas-price`
# configured on the chain. This is to ensure that at least some minimal price is 
# paid for each unit of gas per transaction.
# 
# Required
gas_price = { price = 0.001, denom = 'stake' }

# Multiply this amount with the gas estimate, used to compute the fee
# and account for potential estimation error.
#
# The purpose of multiplying by `gas_multiplier` is to provide a bit of a buffer
# to catch some of the cases when the gas estimation calculation is on the low
# end. 
# 
# Example: With this setting set to 1.1, then if the estimated gas
# is 80_000, then gas used to compute the fee will be adjusted to
# 80_000 * 1.1 = 88_000.
#
# Default: 1.1, ie. the gas is increased by 10%
# Minimum value: 1.0
gas_multiplier = 1.1

# Specify how many IBC messages at most to include in a single transaction.
# Default: 30
max_msg_num = 30

# Specify the maximum size, in bytes, of each transaction that Hermes will submit.
# Default: 2097152 (2 MiB)
max_tx_size = 2097152

# Specify the maximum amount of time to tolerate a clock drift.
# The clock drift parameter defines how much new (untrusted) header's time
# can drift into the future. Default: 5s
clock_drift = '5s'

# Specify the maximum time per block for this chain.
# The block time together with the clock drift are added to the source drift to estimate
# the maximum clock drift when creating a client on this chain. Default: 30s
# For cosmos-SDK chains a good approximation is `timeout_propose` + `timeout_commit`
# Note: This MUST be the same as the `max_expected_time_per_block` genesis parameter for Tendermint chains.
max_block_time = '30s'

# Specify the amount of time to be used as the light client trusting period.
# It should be significantly less than the unbonding period
# (e.g. unbonding period = 3 weeks, trusting period = 2 weeks).
# Default: 2/3 of the `unbonding period` for Cosmos SDK chains
trusting_period = '14days'

# Specify the trust threshold for the light client, ie. the minimum fraction of validators
# which must overlap across two blocks during light client verification.
# Default: { numerator = '2', denominator = '3' }, ie. 2/3.
# Warning: This is an advanced feature! Modify with caution.
trust_threshold = { numerator = '2', denominator = '3' }

# Specify a string that Hermes will use as a memo for each transaction it submits
# to this chain. The string is limited to 50 characters. Default: '' (empty).
# Note: Hermes will append to the string defined here additional
# operational debugging information, e.g., relayer build version.
memo_prefix = ''

# This section specifies the filters for policy based relaying.
#
# Default: no policy / filters, allow all packets on all channels.
#
# Only packet filtering based on channel identifier can be specified.
# A channel filter has two fields:
# 1. `policy` - one of two types are supported:
#       - 'allow': permit relaying _only on_ the port/channel id in the list below,
#       - 'deny': permit relaying on any channel _except for_ the list below.
# 2. `list` - the list of channels specified by the port and channel identifiers.
#             Optionally, each element may also contains wildcards, for eg. 'ica*'
#             to match all identifiers starting with 'ica' or '*' to match all identifiers.
#
# Example configuration of a channel filter, only allowing packet relaying on
# channel with port ID 'transfer' and channel ID 'channel-0', as well as on
# all ICA channels.
#
# [chains.packet_filter]
# policy = 'allow'
# list = [
#   ['ica*', '*'],
#   ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
# ]

# Specify that the transaction fees should be payed from this fee granter's account.
# Optional. If unspecified (the default behavior), then no fee granter is used, and
# the account specified in `key_name` will pay the tx fees for all transactions
# submitted to this chain.

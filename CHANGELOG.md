# CHANGELOG

## v1.6.0

*July 19th, 2023*

This release of Hermes notably features a new pull-based event source which fetches events from the chain periodically using
the `/block_results` RPC endpoint instead of getting them over WebSocket.
    
To use the new pull-based event source, set 

```toml
event_source = { mode = 'pull', interval = '1s' }`
```

in the per-chain configuration.

Check the `event_source` setting in the example [`config.toml`](config.toml) file in the Hermes repository for more details.

Additionally, it is now possible to skip the scanning phase during Hermes startup,
by disabling clients, connections and channels workers, and setting `clear_on_start` to `false`.
This significantly improve startup time when relaying on chains with hundreds or thousands of open channels, connections and clients.
See the [Performance tuning][perf-tuning] page of the guide for more information.

## v1.5.1
 
*June 5th, 2023*
 
This is a patch release for Hermes, which includes a single bugfix and enables overflow checks in production builds.
 
### BUG FIXES
 
- Fix a panic which can occur when querying connections filtered
  by counterparty chain using `hermes query connections`
  ([\#3381](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3381))
 
### IMPROVEMENTS
 
- Overflow checks are now enabled when Hermes is built in release mode, in
  order to better catch and address potential logic errors leading to overflows
  ([\#3390](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3390))

## v1.5.0

*May 24th, 2023*

üéâ **Hermes v1.5.0** is here, packed with a slew of exciting updates, including
breaking changesüí•, brand-new featuresüéÅ, performance enhancementsüöÄ, and
sweeping improvements‚ú®. 

The one breaking change is the removal of the `unbonding_period` setting
from the chain configuration. This is now replaced by a fresh
`ccv_consumer_chain` setting for Cross-Chain Validation (CCV) consumer chains. 

Also, Hermes has strengthened its misbehavior detection. With the
`mode.misbehaviour.enabled` setting enabled (now the case by default)
the relayer was already closely monitoring on-chain client updates,
comparing submitted headers with those fetched from its RPC node.
In the event of any discrepancy, Hermes would report the misbehaviour
to the chain hosting the IBC client. As of this version,
Hermes will also report the misbehaviour evidence to the reference chain.

This version rolls out a string of performance enhancements. Event batches
are now delivered after a configurable delay, greatly trimming down latency
when relaying, particularly on high-traffic channels. This can be adjusted
using the `batch_delay` setting in the per-chain configuration. Plus, packet
acknowledgments are only queried when there are packet commitments on the
counterparty, resulting in a major speed boost for packet clearing and
on-start scanning! üöÄ

In addition, the `trusted_node` setting can now specify whether the full node
Hermes connects to is trusted or not. If untrusted, the light client will
verify headers included in the `ClientUpdate` message.
However, a word of caution: configuring the full node as trusted may cut
down latency but could risk sending invalid client updates to the chain. Use wisely! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Our [Hermes guide](https://hermes.informal.systems/) has been re-organized a bit,
now featuring a new [*Performance Tuning*][perf-guide] page that details the
settings for optimizing the performance of the relayer.

For all the debuggers out there, Hermes now equips a new `--debug` global
flag with several selectable values, and two bonus flags, `--archive-address`
and `--restart-height` that enable a client update following a genesis restart
without an IBC upgrade proposal.

When it comes to telemetry, the destination chain is now added to the labels of
the confirmed packet metrics.

Take note that some metrics now have the suffix `_total`. If you're using a running a
Grafana dashboard or any other tool relying on the metric names or labels, an update might be needed.
The [corresponding page in the guide][telemetry-guide] reflects the new metric names and
labels for your convenience.

There's also a fresh configuration option to specify the directory used for the
keyring store.

From this version onwards, multi-platform (arm64 and amd64) images will be
distributed both on Docker Hub and the GitHub Content Repository.

### Note for operators

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Be aware that this release contains a couple breaking
> ‚ö†Ô∏è  changes to the Hermes configuration and telemetry metrics.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Please consult the [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md) document for more details.

[perf-guide]: https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/configuration/performance.html
[telemetry-guide]: https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/telemetry/operators.html

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Remove the `unbonding_period` setting from the chain configuration,
  which was only used for CCV consumern chains.
  Instead, use the `ccv_consumer_chain` setting to identify a CCV consumer chains.
  ([\#3125](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3125))

- Due to the update of an internal dependency, some Prometheus metrics now have a `_total` suffix.
  Check the corresponding [guide page][telemetry-guide] for the list of all metrics,
  including their new suffixes and labels.

### BUG FIXES

- Support CometBFT when running version checks
  ([\#3288](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3288))

### FEATURES

- Add `ccv_consumer_chain` setting to the chain configuration
  to properly fetch the unbonding period of CCV consumer chains
  ([\#3125](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3125))

- Publish multi-platform (arm64/amd64) images to Docker Hub and GHCR
  ([\#3303](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3303))

- When enabled for misbehaviour (ie. when `mode.misbehaviour.enabled = true`),
  Hermes will now monitor on-chain client updates and verifies the submitted
  headers comparing with headers it retrieves from its RPC node.
  If it detects conflicting headers, it will submit a `MisbehaviourMsg`
  to the chain hosting the IBC client.
  In addition, Hermes will now also submit the evidence to the reference chain.
  ([\#3224](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3224))

- Add a global flag `--debug` which can take one or more of the following values, separated by commas:
    * `rpc`: show RPC debug logs
    * `profiling`: show profiling information in the console
    * `profiling-json`: dump the profiling information to a JSON file in the directory specified in `PROFILING_DIR` env variable if present, or the current directory otherwise.
  ([#2852](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/2852))
  [#3332](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3332))

- Add two optional flags `--archive-address` and `--restart-height` to
  `hermes update client` CLI allowing a client update after a genesis
  restart without an IBC upgrade proposal.
  ([#1152](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1152))


### PERFORMANCE

- Emit event batches after a configurable delay.
  This considerably reduces the latency when relaying
  and therefore increases performance substantially on high traffic channels.
  See the `batch_delay` setting in the per-chain configuration.
  ([\#3331](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3331))

- Only query for packet acknowledgments when there are packet
  commitments on the counterparty, otherwise the query would
  return all acknowledments on chain, which is excruciatingly slow
  ([\#3348](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3348))

- Use `/header` RPC endpoint instead of `/block` to
  reduce pressure on the node and improve performance
  ([\#3226](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3226))

- Add a new `trusted_node` setting to the per-chain configuration to
  specify whether or not the full node Hermes connects to is trusted.
  If not trusted (ie. `trusted_node = false`), Hermes will verify headers
  included in the `ClientUpdate` message using the light client.
  
  If the full node is configured as trusted then, in addition to headers not being verified,
  the verification traces will not be provided.
  This may cause failure in client updates after significant change in validator sets.
  
  > **Warning**
  > Setting this flag to `true` may reduce latency but at the expense of
  > potentially sending invalid client updates to the chain, only use
  > when latency is more critical than operating costs. Use at your own risk.
  
  ([\#3330](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3330))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Enable misbehaviour detection by default
  ([#3001](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3001))
- Add the destination chain to the labels of the confirmed packet metrics
  ([#3297](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3297))
- Added a configuration to specify the directory used to the keyring store
  ([#1541](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1541))
- Switch away from `rouille` to `axum` in telemetry and REST servers
  ([\#1658](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1658))
- Add Juno to chains tested in the integration tests
  ([#3235](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3235))
- Add White Whale migaloo chain to ICS29 tests
  ([#3345](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3345))

## v1.4.1
 
*May 2nd, 2023*
 
This patch release adds support for CometBFT in version checks.
 
### BUG FIXES
 
- Support CometBFT when running version checks
  ([\#3288](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/3288))

## v1.4.0
*March 27th, 2023*

Hermes v1.4.0 brings compatibility with chains based on Tendermint/CometBFT 0.37,
while retaining compatiblity with Tendermint/CometBFT 0.34. This is transparent
and does not require any additional configuration.

The relayer now supports ICS consumer chains, which only requires operators
to specify the `unbonding_period` parameter in the chain settings. This is only
a temporary requirement, in the future Hermes will seamlessy support consumer
chains with minimal changes to the configuration.

This release also deprecates support for chains based on Cosmos SDK 0.43.x and lower,
and bumps the compatiblity to Cosmos SDK 0.47.x.

The relayer now also allows operators to filter out packets to relay based on whether
or not they contain a fee, and the minimal amount of such fee.
Please check the relevant [documentation in the Hermes guide](fee-guide) for more information.
Additionnaly, Hermes now also tracks [metrics for ICS29 fees](fee-metrics).

This release includes a new `query client status` CLI to quickly check whether a client is active, expired or frozen.

  ([#2890](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/2890))

## v1.1.0

*October 28th, 2022*

### Note to developers

The [`ibc`][ibc] and [`ibc-proto`][ibc-proto] crates
[have been split into their own repositories][split-tweet] under
the `cosmos` organization.

Moreover, Hermes [will not be using][split-issue] the original `ibc` crate anymore,
and will from now on use instead the `ibc-relayer-types` crate, which is a
trimmed down version of the `ibc` crate that contains only the data structures used by Hermes.

### General

The `gm` binary has been split out of the repo and has been moved into its own [repository](https://github.com/informalsystems/gm).
This change doesn't affect current local instances of the `gm` binary,
though new versions will need to be sourced from the new repository by running
`git clone informalsystems/gm` and running the install script from there.

For more information, see [this section](https://hermes.informal.systems/tutorials/pre-requisites/gaiad-manager.html#how-to-run) of the Hermes guide.

## v1.0.0
*August 22nd, 2022*

After more than 2 years in the works, this is the first stable release of the Hermes relayer! üéâ

For reaching this milestone, we thank the valuable contributions of over 50 individuals, spread across more than 800 documented & resolved issues. Beside Cosmos-SDK and Tendermint, we are fortunate to maintain some of the most active and intense repository in the Cosmos ecosystem. Most importantly, we thank the relentless work of relayer operators that have already relayed billions worth of value in IBC production networks, and have provided us with invaluable feedback on improving Hermes and raising the overall stability of IBC. Kudos to everyone!

### Note for operators

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  If upgrading from Hermes v0.15.0, be aware that this release contains multiple breaking
> ‚ö†Ô∏è  changes to the Hermes command-line interface and configuration.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Please consult the [UPGRADING document for instructions](UPGRADING.md) for more details.

### Highlights

- The performance and reliability of the relayer has been greatly improved
- Merged commands `keys add` and `keys restore` into single command `keys add`
  The flag to specify the key name for the CLI command `keys add` has been changed
  from `-n` to `-k`. Restoring a key now takes a file containing the mnemonic as
  input instead of directly taking the mnemonic
- Deprecated `gas_adjustment` setting in favor of new `gas_multiplier` setting.
  Check out the [upgrading instructions][gas-mul] for more details about the new setting.
- Updated all CLI commands to take flags instead of positional arguments
- Renamed `query packet unreceived-packets` to `query packet pending-sends`
  and `query packet unreceived-acks` to `query packet pending-acks`
- Added CLI command `keys balance` which outputs the balance of an account associated with a key
- Added CLI command `query channel client` which outputs the channel's client state
- Added CLI command `query transfer denom-trace` which outputs the base denomination and path of a given trace hash
- Dropped the `raw` prefix from all the `tx raw` commands
- Remove the four duplicate commands:
  * `tx raw update-client`, which is the same as `update client`
  * `tx raw upgrade-client`, which is the same as `upgrade client`
  * `tx raw upgrade-clients`, which is the same as `upgrade clients`
  * `tx raw create-client`, which is the same as `create client`
- [A new section was added to guide][telemetry-guide] which describes how the new metrics
  can be used to observe both the current state of the relayer and the networks it is connected to
- Added many new metrics to the telemetry. The full list can be found in new the guide section linked above

### Change to the versioning scheme

As of v1.0.0-rc.0, the Hermes CLI is now versioned separately from
the other crates in the project. As such, the top-level version
designates the version of the Hermes CLI, but the other crates in
the repository do not necessarily match this version. For example,
the `ibc` and `ibc-relayer` crates are released under version 0.19.0
for Hermes v1.0.0.

The structure of this changelog has therefore changed as well,
changes are now grouped first by crate and then by the type of change,
eg. feature, bug fix, etc.

### Full release notes

The release notes below only contain the changes introduced since v1.0.0-rc.2.

This release notably features a new [`query packet pending`][pending] command to
list outstanding packet commitments that are either unreceived or pending
acknowledgement at both ends of a channel.

The `ibc` crate now also come with a complete [ICS 026][ics-26] implementation.

### Note for operators

There is a new `query packet pending` command, see above for more information.

The `create channel` command now requires an existing client and connection,
unless the `--new-client-connection` flag is provided.

    commitments that are either unreceived or pending acknowledgement
    at both ends of a channel.
    ([#1862](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1862))

## v0.13.0
*March 28th, 2022*

Hermes v0.13.0 improves performance by lowering the pressure
on the full nodes by adding a caching layer for some queries.
It also fixes a bug which could cause an exponential slowdown
when relaying between many chains with a low average block time.

This release also add support for wildcards in port and channel identifiers
in the packet filter configuration, which enable operators to filter
ICA channels based on the port prefix.

Additionally, the IBC Protocol Buffers definitions can now be used from CosmWasm.

### Note for operators

As of version 0.13.0, Hermes supports relaying on [Interchain Accounts][ica] channels.

If the `packet_filter` option in the chain configuration is disabled, then
Hermes will relay on all existing and future channels, including ICA channels.

There are two kinds of ICA channels:

1. The host channels, whose port is `icahost`
2. The controller channels, whose port starts with `icacontroller-` followed
   by the owner account address. [See the spec for more details][ica].

If you wish to only relay on a few specific standard channels (here `channel-0` and `channel-1`),
but also relay on all ICA channels, you can specify the following packet filter:

> Note the use of wildcards in the port and channel identifiers (`['ica*', '*']`)
> to match over all the possible ICA ports.

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  ['ica*', '*'], # allow relaying on all channels whose port starts with `ica`
  ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
  ['transfer', 'channel-1'],
  # Add any other port/channel pairs you wish to relay on
]
```

If you wish to relay on all channels but not on ICA channels, you can use
the following packet filter configuration:

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'deny'
list = [
  ['ica*', '*'], # deny relaying on all channels whose port starts with `ica`
]
```

This information can also be found in the [Hermes guide][guide-ica].

[guide-ica]: https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/configuration/configure-hermes.html#support-for-interchain-accounts

### BUG FIXES

- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Fixed relayer behavior on ordered channels
    ([#1835](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1835))
  - Do not spawn packet worker on chan open ack/confirm events
    ([#1991](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1991))
  - Fix a bug which would cause the relayer to slow down exponentially when either
    the average block time was low or when it was relaying on too many chains at
    once ([#2008](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/2008))

### FEATURES

- [IBC Proto](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs)
  - Add CosmWasm support to the generated Protobuf code ([#4](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/4))
    * Add a new `client` feature to gate the tonic client code, implies the `std` feature.
    * Add a new `json-schema` feature to derive `schemars::JsonSchema` on some proto types, implies the `std` feature.
    * Add `#[serde(default)]` to fields that might be omitted by Golang `omitempty` directive.
    * Change serialization of byte arrays to Base64 for compatibility with Go.
  - Derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for `ibc-proto::ibc::core` and `ibc_proto::ibc::applications` structs,
    and switch to Google's Protobuf standard types instead of Prost's types.
    ([#3](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/3))
- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Added caching layer for hermes start command
    ([#1908](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1908))
  - Add support for wildcards in port and channel identifiers in the packet filter configuration,
    which enable operators to filter ICA channels based on the port prefix
    ([#1927](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1927))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [IBC Modules](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)
  - Refactored channels events in ICS 04 module
    ([#86](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/86))
- [Integration Test Framework](crates/relayer-cli)
  - Split out test framework as new crate `ibc-test-framework` from `ibc-integration-test`. ([#1961](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1961))

  - Add documentation for the caching layer implemented in ([#1908](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1908))
- [Relayer CLI](crates/relayer-cli)
  - Print packet data on one line ([#1559](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1559))

## v0.12.0
*February 24th, 2022*

This release notably brings compatibility with Cosmos SDK 0.45 and IBC v3.0.0-rc.0,
as well as support for non-standard ports in the channel handshake.
It also contains a fix for a bug where `SendPacket` events were duplicated when emitted at EndBlock,
and fixes another bug where Hermes would clear packet at startup even when `clear_on_start = false`.
The relayer will now also honor the `tracing` filter specified in the `RUST_LOG` environment variable, if any.

### Note for operators

As of this release, the relayer will not respond to the `SIGHUP` signal and will therefore
not reload the configuration anymore. This feature has been deemed unnecessary given the
recent performance improvements, and it is now recommended to just restart the relayer
when the configuration is updated.

Additionally, a new CLI command [`clear packets`](https://hermes.informal.systems/documentation/commands/relaying/clear.html)
has been added for clearing packets in both direction on a given channel.

### BUG FIXES

- [IBC Modules](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)
  - Fixed the formatting of NotEnoughTimeElapsed and NotEnoughBlocksElapsed
    in Tendermint errors ([#24](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/24))

  - Fix support for non-standard ports in channel handshake
    ([#1861](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1861),
    [#1837](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1837))
  - Fixed bug where Hermes cleared packets at startup, despite
    `clear_on_start = false` ([#1872](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1872))
- [Relayer CLI](crates/relayer-cli)
  - Disable reloading of configuration upon receiving a SIGHUP signal
    ([#1885](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1885))

  - Upgrade protos and compatibility to IBC v3.0.0-rc.0 and Cosmos SDK v0.45.1
    ([#5](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/issues/5))
- [Relayer CLI](crates/relayer-cli)
  - Allow overriding the tracing filter with `RUST_LOG` environment variable
    ([#1895](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1895))

### IMPROVEMENTS

    ([#1388](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1388))
  - Changed `ConnectionEnd::versions` method to be non-allocating by having it return a `&[Version]` instead of `Vec<Version>`
    ([#55](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/55))
- [Relayer CLI](crates/relayer-cli)
  - Added `clear packets` command, combining the effects of
    `tx raw packet-recv` and `tx raw packet-ack`
    ([#1834](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1834))

## v0.11.1
*February 4th, 2022*

This release mainly adds support for channel events originating from Tendermint ABCI's `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` methods.

### BUG FIXES

- [Relayer CLI](crates/relayer-cli)
  - Do not require a config file to be present for the `completions` command.
    ([#1822](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1822))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Increased tx confirmation timeout to 300s to prevent aggressive tx
    resubmission ([#1663](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1663))

    ([#1793](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1793))


## v0.11.0
*January 27th, 2022*

This release notably speeds up the startup time of Hermes,
adds options to the `create client` command to customize the client parameters,
makes the deposit denomination configurable in `tx raw upgrade-chain` via a new `--denom` flag,
and adds a `completions` CLI command to generate shell auto-completion scripts.

### Note for operators

This release includes a breaking change, which requires the configuration file to be edited.
The `mode.packets.filter` configuration option has been removed and is now enabled by default.

Before running Hermes v0.11.0, make sure you remove the `mode.packets.filter` option from the configuration file.

  - Initialize consensus metadata on client creation
    ([#1763](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1763))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- General
  - Improve startup time of the relayer ([#1705](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1705))
      * When scanning a chain with filtering enabled and an allow list, skip scanning all the clients and query the allowed channels directly. This results in much fewer queries and a faster start.
      * Add a `--full-scan` option to `hermes start` to opt out of the fast start mechanism and do a full scan.
  - Update `tendermint-rs` to v0.23.4 and harmonize the dependencies to use a single TLS stack.
    A system installation of OpenSSL is no longer required to build Hermes.
    ([#1641](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1641))

    ([#1789](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1789))

## v0.10.0
*January 13th, 2021*

This release notably updates the underlying CLI framework (`abscissa`) to version 0.6.0-beta.1,
which now uses `clap` for parsing command line arguments. This substantially improves the UX of the CLI,
by adding support for `--help` flags in subcommands and improving help and usage printouts.

The `--version` option of the `create channel` subcommand has been renamed
to `--channel-version`, with the old name still supported as an alias.
Additionally, the `-h` short flag on many commands is now `-H` to avoid
clashes with the clap-provided short flag for help.

This release also improves the handling of account sequence mismatch errors,
with a recovery mechanism to automatically retry or drop tx upon such errors.

The relayer now also supports dynamic versions in channel open handshake (which is needed by Interchain Accounts), and enables full support for IBC v2.

## v0.9.0, the ‚ÄúZamfir‚Äù release
*November 23rd, 2021*

> This release honors Anca Zamfir, who has lead ibc-rs from its inception and through its first two years of life.
> The whole team is grateful for her dedication and the nurturing environment she created.
> To many more achievements, Anca!! ü•Ç

#### Notice for operators

This release requires operators to update their Hermes configuration.
The `mode` configuration section now replaces the `strategy` option.

##### `strategy = 'packets'`

If Hermes was configured with `strategy = 'packets'`, then the configuration needs to be changed in the following way:

```diff
 [global]
-strategy = 'packets'
 log_level = 'trace'
-clear_packets_interval = 100
-tx_confirmation = true
+
+[mode]
+
+[mode.clients]
+enabled = true
+refresh = true
+misbehaviour = true
+
+[mode.connections]
+enabled = false
+
+[mode.channels]
+enabled = false
+
+[mode.packets]
+enabled = true
+clear_interval = 100
+clear_on_start = true
+filter = false
+tx_confirmation = true
```

##### `strategy = 'all'`

If Hermes was configured to complete connection and channel handshakes as well, ie. with `strategy = 'all'`,
then on top of the changes above, `mode.connections.enabled` and `mode.channels.enabled` must be set to `true`.

[See the relevant section][config-mode-toml] of the documented `config.toml` file in the repository for more details.

[config-mode-toml]: https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/blob/v0.9.0/config.toml#L9-L59


### BUG FIXES

- [IBC Modules](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)
  - Set the connection counterparty in the ICS 003 [`connOpenAck` handler][conn-open-ack-handler]
    ([#70](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/70))

[conn-open-ack-handler]: https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/blob/main/crates/ibc/src/core/ics03_connection/handler/conn_open_ack.rs

### FEATURES

- General
  - Support for compatibility with gaia Vega upgrade (protos matching ibc-go v1.2.2 and SDK v0.44.3)
    ([#1408](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1408))
  - Optimize the WS client to subscribe to IBC events only (instead of all Tx
    events) ([#1534](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1534))
- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Allow for more granular control of relaying modes. The `mode` configuration section replaces the `strategy` option.
    ([#1518](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1518))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- General
  - Upgrade IBC-rs TLA+ MBT models to modern Apalache type annotations
    ([#69](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/69))
  - Add `architecture.md` doc that gives a high-level overview of the structure of the codebase
  - Add some module-level documentation ([#1556](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1556))
- [IBC Modules](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)
  - Derive `PartialEq` and `Eq` on `IbcEvent` and inner types
    ([#1546](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/68))
- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - The relayer will now avoid submitting a tx after the simulation failed
    (in all but one special case) to avoid wasting fees unnecessarily
    ([#1479](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1479))
- [Relayer CLI](crates/relayer-cli)
  - Output errors on a single line if ANSI output is disabled
    ([#1529](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1529))
  - Compute fee amount using big integers to prevent overflow
    when using denominations with high decimal places
    ([#1555](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1555))

## v0.8.0
*October 29th, 2021*

This is the final release of version 0.8.0, which now depends on the official releases of the `prost` and `tonic` crates.
In addition to everything that's included in v0.8.0-pre.1, this release updates the minimum supported Rust version to 1.56,
and contains various bug fixes and performance improvements which make the relayer more reliable.

#### Notice for operators
A new setting was added to the Hermes configuration: `max_block_time`.
This setting specifies the maximum time per block for this chain.
The block time together with the clock drift are added to the source drift to estimate
the maximum clock drift when creating a client on this chain.
For Cosmos-SDK chains a good approximation is `timeout_propose` + `timeout_commit`

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Update MSRV to Rust 1.56 and use the 2021 edition
  ([#1519](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1519))

### BUG FIXES

- Fix for "new header has a time from the future" chain error which would arise due to clock drift ([#1445](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1445)):
  * Added new config param `max_block_time` to prevent the problem for appearing in newly-created clients.
  * Added a synchronous waiting in client update logic to allow destination chain to reach a new height
    before submitting a client update message.
- Ensure Hermes does not send timeouts for packets that have not expired yet
    ([#1504](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1504))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- General
  - Update to official releases of `prost` 0.9 and `tonic` 0.6
    ([#1502](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1502))
- [IBC Modules](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)
  - Support for converting `ibc::events::IbcEvent` into `tendermint::abci::Event`
    ([#81](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/81))
  - Restructure the layout of the `ibc` crate to match `ibc-go`'s [layout](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go#contents)
    ([#1436](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1436))
  - Implement `FromStr<Path>` to enable string-encoded paths to be converted into Path identifiers
    ([#1460](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1460))
- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Improve performance of misbehaviour checks triggered by an `UpdateClient` event
    ([#1417](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1417))

## v0.8.0-pre.1
*October 22nd, 2021*

This is a pre-release which depends on in-house forks of various Rust libraries.
As such, it is advised to avoid depending on the `ibc` and `ibc-relayer` crates
at version 0.8.0-pre.1.

Hermes v0.8.0-pre.1 is considered stable and it is recommended for all
users to update to this version.

This release notably includes a new [`memo_prefix`][memo] configuration option
for specifying a prefix to be included in the memo of each transaction submitted
by Hermes.

Moreover, Hermes is now able to handle `SendPacket` events originating from Tendermint
ABCI's `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` methods ([#1231](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1231)).

[memo]: https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/blob/v0.8.0-pre.1/config.toml#L161-L165

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [IBC Modules](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)
  - The `check_header_and_update_state` method of the `ClientDef`
    trait (ICS02) has been expanded to facilitate ICS07
    ([#71](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/71))

### FEATURES

- General
  - Add support for the `tx.memo` field
    ([#1433](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1433))
- [IBC Modules](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs)

    ([#71](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/71))
- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Add a `default_gas` setting to be used for submitting a tx when tx simulation
    fails ([#1457](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1457))
  - Update compatibility check for IBC-Go dependency
    ([#1464](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1464))

### IMPROVEMENTS

    check for the trusting period being smaller than the unbonding period
    ([#1440](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1440))

## v0.7.3
*October 4th, 2021*

This minor release most notably includes a fix for a bug introduced in v0.7.0
where Hermes would always use the max gas when submitting transactions to
chains based on Cosmos SDK <= 0.42.
It also improves the handling of account sequence numbers

### BUG FIXES

- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Fix a bug introduced in Hermes v0.7.0 where tx simulations would fail on
    chains based on Cosmos SDK 0.42. This would cause Hermes to use the max
    gas specified in the config when submitted the tx, leading to high fees.
    ([#1345](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1345))
  - Only increase cached account sequence number when `broadcast_tx_sync` fails,
    therefore ensuring that the cached sequence number stays in sync with the
    node. ([#1402](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1402))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [Relayer Library](crates/relayer)
  - Set default trusting period to be 2/3 of unbonding period for Cosmos chains
    ([#1392](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/pull/1392))

## v0.7.2
*September 24th, 2021*

- Improve performance of health check, and only perform it on `hermes start`.
  Add a `hermes health-check` command. ([#1336](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1336))
- Treat pre-releases of the Cosmos SDK as their standard version in compatibility check ([#1337](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1337))
- Bump Cosmos SDK compatibility to v0.44.0 ([#1344](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1344))
- Improve reliability of health check ([#1382](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/issues/1376))

## v0.7.1
*September 14th, 2021*

## v0.6.0
*July 12th, 2021*


Many thanks to Fraccaroli Gianmarco (@Fraccaman) for helping us improve the
reliability of Hermes ([#697]).

This release includes two major features to Hermes: (1) support for reloading
the chains from the configuration file at runtime, and (2) a filtering mechanism
to restrict Hermes activity based on predefined parameters (e.g., packet relaying
on certain ports and channels exclusively, and ignoring activity for clients
that have non-standard trust threshold).

In addition to these two, we have also added a health checkup mechanism, plus new
`config validate` and `query channel ends` CLIs.

### Upgrading from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0

When upgrading from Hermes v0.5.0 to v0.6.0, the most important
point to watch out for is the configuration file.
The Hermes config.toml configuration file has went through a few revisions,
with the changes described below.

#### Added inline documentation for all options.

Please have a look around the [config.toml](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/blob/v0.6.0/config.toml) directly.

#### Added a packet filtering mechanism based on channel/port identifiers

This feature will restrict the channels on which Hermes relays packets.
There are two new options in the configuration file:

1. A global `filter` parameter to enable or disable filtering globally.
2. A per-chain `.filters` option that expects a `policy` (either `allow` or
   `deny`) plus a list of channel and
   port identifiers. If policy is `allow`, then packet relaying will be restricted to this
   list for the corresponding chain. If the policy is `deny`, then any packets
   from this list will be ignored.

#### Added filtering based on client state

The global `filter` option additionally enables filtering of all activities
based on client state trust threshold. If enabled, Hermes will ignore all
activity for clients that have a trust threshold different than `1/3`.

#### Added a packet clearing configuration option

This will enable the parametrization of the frequency
at which Hermes will clear pending packets. This is a global option, called
`clear_packets_interval`, which applies to all chains in the configuration.


The full list of changes is described below.

### FEATURES

- [ibc-relayer]
  - The chains configuration can be reloaded by sending the Hermes process a `SIGHUP` signal ([#1117])
  - Added support for filtering based on client state trust threshold ([#1165])

- [ibc-relayer-cli]

## v0.5.0
*June 22nd, 2021*

This release brings a few features, and several improvements and bug fixes to the Hermes
relayer, notably the capability for Hermes to complete IBC connection handshakes when
it detects that one has been initialized, as well as the ability to detect chain
impersonation attacks and to dynamically estimate the gas needed to submit
a transaction.

Moreover, the overall reliability and availability of the relayer has also been improved
substantially by switching over to `tx_broadcast_sync` for submitting transactions.

### FEATURES

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Add `--hd-path` option to `keys restore` and `keys add` commands to specify
    derivation path when importing keys ([#1049])

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Event-based handshake completion for IBC connections ([#821])
  - Enable TLS support for gRPC client ([#877])

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Minor log output improvements: color enabled, reduced redundant information ([#1100])

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Update the on-chain IBC client with supporting headers when light client verification
    performs bisection when verifying a header for a client update or a misbehaviour detection ([#673])
  - Add mitigation for chain impersonation attacks ([#1038])
  - Determine gas fee dynamically per transaction ([#930])
  - Submit transactions with `broadcast_tx_sync` and keep track of account sequences ([#986])

### BUG FIXES

- [gaiad-manager]
  - Removed the testnet command as not all networks support it ([#1050])
  - Update for compatibility with Hermes's new `--hd-path` option

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Fix bug where channels were left partially open after `channel create` ([#1064])
  - Prevent account sequence mismatch errors in many cases ([#919], [#978])
  - Prevent timeouts when submitting transactins ([#977])

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Removed `--coin-type` option from `keys restore` command. Use `--hd-path` instead ([#1049])

## v0.4.0
*June 3rd, 2021*

- This release of Hermes features an internal [telemetry service][telemetry]
  which can export metrics about the relayer to Prometheus.
- A new [relaying strategy][strategy] is now available, which enables Hermes to
  complete channel handshakes in an event-based fashion.
- Hermes now checks if another relayer may have already processed a packet event,
  and will not attempt to process it itself, which improves performance.
- The startup time of the relayer has been substantially improved.
- The `start-multi` command has been promoted to `start`, which means
  that the worker-based relayer is not experimental anymore.
- A regression where Hermes would not recover after a node went down and up again was fixed.

## 0.0.1

*July 1st, 2020*

This is the initial prototype release of an IBC relayer and TLA+ specifications.
There are no compatibility guarantees until v0.1.0.

Includes:

- Configuration file definition and validation
- Client state, consensus state, connection, channel queries.
    - Note: deserialization is unimplemented as it has dependency on migration to protobuf for ABCI queries
- Per chain light clients threads are created and headers are periodically retrieved and verified.
- Per chain IBC event monitor threads are spawned and main event handler that receives them.
    - Note: the event handler just displays the events.
- IBC Modules partial implementation for datastructures, messages and queries.
- Some English and TLA+ specifications for Connection & Channel Handshake as well as naive relayer algorithm.

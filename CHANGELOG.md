## v0.0.4
*October 19, 2020*

This release focuses on alignment with the Cosmos ecosystem: adaptations to Tendermint-rs 0.16 and subsequently to 0.17 (`0.17.0-rc1`), and numerous protobuf updates following latest stargate releases.

Additional highlights:
- Adding DomainTypes and (de)serialization capability to ICS02 and ICS03 messages and structures.

This release is focused on updating the query system from amino to protobuf,

It does not target a stable release of Cosmos-SDK chains, but is tracking
the latest state of development towards the Cosmos-SDK Stargate release.

- [modules|relayer] Refactor queries, paths, and Chain trait to reduce code and use
  protobuf instead of Amino.

    the Cosmos-SDK's `simd` binary with prepopulated IBC state in the genesis
        [\#140](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/140),
        [\#184](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/184)

## 0.0.1

*July 1st, 2020*

This is the initial prototype release of an IBC relayer and TLA+ specifications.
There are no compatibility guarantees until v0.1.0.

Includes:

- Configuration file definition and validation
- Client state, consensus state, connection, channel queries.
    - Note: deserialization is unimplemented as it has dependency on migration to protobuf for ABCI queries
- Per chain light clients threads are created and headers are periodically retrieved and verified.
- Per chain IBC event monitor threads are spawned and main event handler that receives them.
    - Note: the event handler just displays the events.
- IBC Modules partial implementation for datastructures, messages and queries.
- Some English and TLA+ specifications for Connection & Channel Handshake as well as naive relayer algorithm.

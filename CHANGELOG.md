    ([#1862](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1862))

## v0.13.0
*March 28th, 2022*

Hermes v0.13.0 improves performance by lowering the pressure
on the full nodes by adding a caching layer for some queries.
It also fixes a bug which could cause an exponential slowdown
when relaying between many chains with a low average block time.

This release also add support for wildcards in port and channel identifiers
in the packet filter configuration, which enable operators to filter
ICA channels based on the port prefix.

Additionally, the IBC Protocol Buffers definitions can now be used from CosmWasm.

### Note for operators

As of version 0.13.0, Hermes supports relaying on [Interchain Accounts][ica] channels.

If the `packet_filter` option in the chain configuration is disabled, then
Hermes will relay on all existing and future channels, including ICA channels.

There are two kinds of ICA channels:

1. The host channels, whose port is `icahost`
2. The controller channels, whose port starts with `icacontroller-` followed
   by the owner account address. [See the spec for more details][ica].

If you wish to only relay on a few specific standard channels (here `channel-0` and `channel-1`),
but also relay on all ICA channels, you can specify the following packet filter:

> Note the use of wildcards in the port and channel identifiers (`['ica*', '*']`)
> to match over all the possible ICA ports.

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
  ['ica*', '*'], # allow relaying on all channels whose port starts with `ica`
  ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
  ['transfer', 'channel-1'],
  # Add any other port/channel pairs you wish to relay on
]
```

If you wish to relay on all channels but not on ICA channels, you can use
the following packet filter configuration:

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'deny'
list = [
  ['ica*', '*'], # deny relaying on all channels whose port starts with `ica`
]
```

This information can also be found in the [Hermes guide][guide-ica].

[guide-ica]: https://hermes.informal.systems/config.html#support-for-interchain-accounts

### BUG FIXES

- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Fixed relayer behavior on ordered channels
    ([#1835](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1835))
  - Do not spawn packet worker on chan open ack/confirm events
    ([#1991](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1991))
  - Fix a bug which would cause the relayer to slow down exponentially when either
    the average block time was low or when it was relaying on too many chains at
    once ([#2008](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/2008))

### FEATURES

- [IBC Proto](proto)
  - Add CosmWasm support to the generated Protobuf code ([#1913](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1913))
    * Add a new `client` feature to gate the tonic client code, implies the `std` feature.
    * Add a new `json-schema` feature to derive `schemars::JsonSchema` on some proto types, implies the `std` feature.
    * Add `#[serde(default)]` to fields that might be omitted by Golang `omitempty` directive.
    * Change serialization of byte arrays to Base64 for compatibility with Go.
  - Derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for `ibc-proto::ibc::core` and `ibc_proto::ibc::applications` structs,
    and switch to Google's Protobuf standard types instead of Prost's types.
    ([#1988](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1988))
- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Added caching layer for hermes start command
    ([#1908](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1908))
  - Add support for wildcards in port and channel identifiers in the packet filter configuration,
    which enable operators to filter ICA channels based on the port prefix
    ([#1927](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1927))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [IBC Modules](modules)
  - Refactored channels events in ICS 04 module
    ([#718](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/718))
- [Integration Test Framework](relayer-cli)
  - Split out test framework as new crate `ibc-test-framework` from `ibc-integration-test`. ([#1961](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/1961))
- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Add documentation for the caching layer implemented in ([#1908](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1908))
- [Relayer CLI](relayer-cli)
  - Print packet data on one line ([#1559](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1559))

## v0.12.0
*February 24th, 2022*

This release notably brings compatibility with Cosmos SDK 0.45 and IBC v3.0.0-rc.0,
as well as support for non-standard ports in the channel handshake.
It also contains a fix for a bug where `SendPacket` events were duplicated when emitted at EndBlock,
and fixes another bug where Hermes would clear packet at startup even when `clear_on_start = false`.
The relayer will now also honor the `tracing` filter specified in the `RUST_LOG` environment variable, if any.

### Note for operators

As of this release, the relayer will not respond to the `SIGHUP` signal and will therefore
not reload the configuration anymore. This feature has been deemed unnecessary given the
recent performance improvements, and it is now recommended to just restart the relayer
when the configuration is updated.

Additionally, a new CLI command [`clear packets`](https://hermes.informal.systems/commands/relaying/clear.html)
has been added for clearing packets in both direction on a given channel.

### BUG FIXES

- [IBC Modules](modules)
  - Fixed the formatting of NotEnoughTimeElapsed and NotEnoughBlocksElapsed
    in Tendermint errors ([#1706](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1706))

    ([#1861](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1861),
    [#1837](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1837))
  - Fixed bug where Hermes cleared packets at startup, despite
    `clear_on_start = false` ([#1872](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1872))
- [Relayer CLI](relayer-cli)

    ([#1388](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1388))
  - Changed `ConnectionEnd::versions` method to be non-allocating by having it return a `&[Version]` instead of `Vec<Version>`
    ([#1880](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/1880))
- [Relayer CLI](relayer-cli)
  - Added `clear packets` command, combining the effects of
    `tx raw packet-recv` and `tx raw packet-ack`
    ([#1834](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/1834))

## v0.11.1

    ([#1793](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1793))


## v0.11.0
*January 27th, 2022*

This release notably speeds up the startup time of Hermes,
adds options to the `create client` command to customize the client parameters,
makes the deposit denomination configurable in `tx raw upgrade-chain` via a new `--denom` flag,
and adds a `completions` CLI command to generate shell auto-completion scripts.

### Note for operators

This release includes a breaking change, which requires the configuration file to be edited.
The `mode.packets.filter` configuration option has been removed and is now enabled by default.

Before running Hermes v0.11.0, make sure you remove the `mode.packets.filter` option from the configuration file.

    [#1745](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1745)
  - Initialize consensus metadata on client creation
    ([#1763](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1763))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- General
  - Improve startup time of the relayer ([#1705](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1705))
      * When scanning a chain with filtering enabled and an allow list, skip scanning all the clients and query the allowed channels directly. This results in much fewer queries and a faster start.
      * Add a `--full-scan` option to `hermes start` to opt out of the fast start mechanism and do a full scan.
  - Update `tendermint-rs` to v0.23.4 and harmonize the dependencies to use a single TLS stack.
    A system installation of OpenSSL is no longer required to build Hermes.

    ([#1789](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pull/1789))

## v0.10.0
*January 13th, 2021*

This release notably updates the underlying CLI framework (`abscissa`) to version 0.6.0-beta.1,
which now uses `clap` for parsing command line arguments. This substantially improves the UX of the CLI,
by adding support for `--help` flags in subcommands and improving help and usage printouts.

The `--version` option of the `create channel` subcommand has been renamed
to `--channel-version`, with the old name still supported as an alias.
Additionally, the `-h` short flag on many commands is now `-H` to avoid
clashes with the clap-provided short flag for help.

This release also improves the handling of account sequence mismatch errors,
with a recovery mechanism to automatically retry or drop tx upon such errors.

The relayer now also supports dynamic versions in channel open handshake (which is needed by Interchain Accounts), and enables full support for IBC v2.

## v0.9.0, the “Zamfir” release
*November 23rd, 2021*

> This release honors Anca Zamfir, who has lead ibc-rs from its inception and through its first two years of life.
> The whole team is grateful for her dedication and the nurturing environment she created.
> To many more achievements, Anca!! 🥂

#### Notice for operators

This release requires operators to update their Hermes configuration.
The `mode` configuration section now replaces the `strategy` option.

##### `strategy = 'packets'`

If Hermes was configured with `strategy = 'packets'`, then the configuration needs to be changed in the following way:

```diff
 [global]
-strategy = 'packets'
 log_level = 'trace'
-clear_packets_interval = 100
-tx_confirmation = true
+
+[mode]
+
+[mode.clients]
+enabled = true
+refresh = true
+misbehaviour = true
+
+[mode.connections]
+enabled = false
+
+[mode.channels]
+enabled = false
+
+[mode.packets]
+enabled = true
+clear_interval = 100
+clear_on_start = true
+filter = false
+tx_confirmation = true
```

##### `strategy = 'all'`

If Hermes was configured to complete connection and channel handshakes as well, ie. with `strategy = 'all'`,
then on top of the changes above, `mode.connections.enabled` and `mode.channels.enabled` must be set to `true`.

[See the relevant section][config-mode-toml] of the documented `config.toml` file in the repository for more details.

[config-mode-toml]: https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/v0.9.0/config.toml#L9-L59


### BUG FIXES

- [IBC Modules](modules)
  - Set the connection counterparty in the ICS 003 [`connOpenAck` handler][conn-open-ack-handler]
    ([#1532](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1532))

[conn-open-ack-handler]: https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/master/modules/src/core/ics03_connection/handler/conn_open_ack.rs

### FEATURES

- General
  - Support for compatibility with gaia Vega upgrade (protos matching ibc-go v1.2.2 and SDK v0.44.3)
    ([#1408](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1408))
  - Optimize the WS client to subscribe to IBC events only (instead of all Tx
    events) ([#1534](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1534))
- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Allow for more granular control of relaying modes. The `mode` configuration section replaces the `strategy` option.
    ([#1518](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1518))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- General
  - Upgrade IBC-rs TLA+ MBT models to modern Apalache type annotations
    ([#1544](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1544))
  - Add `architecture.md` doc that gives a high-level overview of the structure of the codebase
  - Add some module-level documentation ([#1556](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/pulls/1556))
- [IBC Modules](modules)
  - Derive `PartialEq` and `Eq` on `IbcEvent` and inner types
    ([#1546](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1546))
- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - The relayer will now avoid submitting a tx after the simulation failed
    (in all but one special case) to avoid wasting fees unnecessarily
    ([#1479](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1479))
- [Relayer CLI](relayer-cli)
  - Output errors on a single line if ANSI output is disabled
    ([#1529](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1529))
  - Compute fee amount using big integers to prevent overflow
    when using denominations with high decimal places
    ([#1555](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1555))

## v0.8.0
*October 29th, 2021*

This is the final release of version 0.8.0, which now depends on the official releases of the `prost` and `tonic` crates.
In addition to everything that's included in v0.8.0-pre.1, this release updates the minimum supported Rust version to 1.56,
and contains various bug fixes and performance improvements which make the relayer more reliable.

#### Notice for operators
A new setting was added to the Hermes configuration: `max_block_time`.
This setting specifies the maximum time per block for this chain.
The block time together with the clock drift are added to the source drift to estimate
the maximum clock drift when creating a client on this chain.
For Cosmos-SDK chains a good approximation is `timeout_propose` + `timeout_commit`

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Update MSRV to Rust 1.56 and use the 2021 edition
  ([#1519](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1519))

### BUG FIXES

- Fix for "new header has a time from the future" chain error which would arise due to clock drift ([#1445](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1445)):
  * Added new config param `max_block_time` to prevent the problem for appearing in newly-created clients.
  * Added a synchronous waiting in client update logic to allow destination chain to reach a new height
    before submitting a client update message.
- Ensure Hermes does not send timeouts for packets that have not expired yet
    ([#1504](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1504))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- General
  - Update to official releases of `prost` 0.9 and `tonic` 0.6
    ([#1502](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1502))
- [IBC Modules](modules)
  - Support for converting `ibc::events::IbcEvent` into `tendermint::abci::Event`
    ([#838](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/838))
  - Restructure the layout of the `ibc` crate to match `ibc-go`'s [layout](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go#contents)
    ([#1436](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1436))
  - Implement `FromStr<Path>` to enable string-encoded paths to be converted into Path identifiers
    ([#1460](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1460))
- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Improve performance of misbehaviour checks triggered by an `UpdateClient` event
    ([#1417](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1417))

## v0.8.0-pre.1
*October 22nd, 2021*

This is a pre-release which depends on in-house forks of various Rust libraries.
As such, it is advised to avoid depending on the `ibc` and `ibc-relayer` crates
at version 0.8.0-pre.1.

Hermes v0.8.0-pre.1 is considered stable and it is recommended for all
users to update to this version.

This release notably includes a new [`memo_prefix`][memo] configuration option
for specifying a prefix to be included in the memo of each transaction submitted
by Hermes.

Moreover, Hermes is now able to handle `SendPacket` events originating from Tendermint
ABCI's `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock` methods ([#1231](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1231)).

[memo]: https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/v0.8.0-pre.1/config.toml#L161-L165

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [IBC Modules](modules)
  - The `check_header_and_update_state` method of the `ClientDef`
    trait (ICS02) has been expanded to facilitate ICS07
    ([#1214](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1214))

### FEATURES

- General
  - Add support for the `tx.memo` field
    ([#1433](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1433))
- [IBC Modules](modules)
  - Add ICS07 verification functionality by using `tendermint-light-client`
    ([#1214](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1214))
- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Add a `default_gas` setting to be used for submitting a tx when tx simulation
    fails ([#1457](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1457))
  - Update compatibility check for IBC-Go dependency
    ([#1464](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1464))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Handle SendPacket events originating from Tendermint ABCI's BeginBlock
    and EndBlock methods ([#1231](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1231))
  - Improve error message when `create client` fails and add a health
    check for the trusting period being smaller than the unbonding period
    ([#1440](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1440))

## v0.7.3
*October 4th, 2021*

This minor release most notably includes a fix for a bug introduced in v0.7.0
where Hermes would always use the max gas when submitting transactions to
chains based on Cosmos SDK <= 0.42.
It also improves the handling of account sequence numbers

### BUG FIXES

- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Fix a bug introduced in Hermes v0.7.0 where tx simulations would fail on
    chains based on Cosmos SDK 0.42. This would cause Hermes to use the max
    gas specified in the config when submitted the tx, leading to high fees.
    ([#1345](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1345))
  - Only increase cached account sequence number when `broadcast_tx_sync` fails,
    therefore ensuring that the cached sequence number stays in sync with the
    node. ([#1402](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1402))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- [Relayer Library](relayer)
  - Set default trusting period to be 2/3 of unbonding period for Cosmos chains
    ([#1392](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1392))

## v0.7.2
*September 24th, 2021*

  - Add the option to set gm-lib path via the `$GM_LIB` environment variable ([#1365](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1365))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Use `core` and `alloc` crates for `no_std` compatibility ([#1156](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1156))
- Improve performance of health check, and only perform it on `hermes start`.
  Add a `hermes health-check` command. ([#1336](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1336))
- Treat pre-releases of the Cosmos SDK as their standard version in compatibility check ([#1337](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1337))
- Bump Cosmos SDK compatibility to v0.44.0 ([#1344](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/issues/1344))

## v0.6.0
*July 12th, 2021*


Many thanks to Fraccaroli Gianmarco (@Fraccaman) for helping us improve the
reliability of Hermes ([#697]).

This release includes two major features to Hermes: (1) support for reloading
the chains from the configuration file at runtime, and (2) a filtering mechanism
to restrict Hermes activity based on predefined parameters (e.g., packet relaying
on certain ports and channels exclusively, and ignoring activity for clients
that have non-standard trust threshold).

In addition to these two, we have also added a health checkup mechanism, plus new
`config validate` and `query channel ends` CLIs.

### Upgrading from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0

When upgrading from Hermes v0.5.0 to v0.6.0, the most important
point to watch out for is the configuration file.
The Hermes config.toml configuration file has went through a few revisions,
with the changes described below.

#### Added inline documentation for all options.

Please have a look around the [config.toml](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/v0.6.0/config.toml) directly.

#### Added a packet filtering mechanism based on channel/port identifiers

This feature will restrict the channels on which Hermes relays packets.
There are two new options in the configuration file:

1. A global `filter` parameter to enable or disable filtering globally.
2. A per-chain `.filters` option that expects a `policy` (either `allow` or
   `deny`) plus a list of channel and
   port identifiers. If policy is `allow`, then packet relaying will be restricted to this
   list for the corresponding chain. If the policy is `deny`, then any packets
   from this list will be ignored.

#### Added filtering based on client state

The global `filter` option additionally enables filtering of all activities
based on client state trust threshold. If enabled, Hermes will ignore all
activity for clients that have a trust threshold different than `1/3`.

#### Added a packet clearing configuration option

This will enable the parametrization of the frequency
at which Hermes will clear pending packets. This is a global option, called
`clear_packets_interval`, which applies to all chains in the configuration.


The full list of changes is described below.

### FEATURES

- [ibc-relayer]
  - The chains configuration can be reloaded by sending the Hermes process a `SIGHUP` signal ([#1117])
  - Added support for filtering based on client state trust threshold ([#1165])

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Added `config validate` CLI to Hermes ([#600])
  - Added filtering capability to deny or allow for specific channels ([#1140], [#1141], [#69])
  - Added basic channel filter ([#1140])
  - Added `query channel ends` CLI command ([#1062])
  - Added a health checkup mechanism for Hermes ([#697, #1057])

### IMPROVEMENTS

- Update to `tendermint-rs` v0.20.0 ([#1125])
- Add inline documentation to config.toml ([#1127])

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Hermes will now clear pending packets at a configurable interval ([#1124])

### BUG FIXES

- [ibc-relayer]
  - Fix for schedule refreshing bug ([#1143])

## v0.5.0
*June 22nd, 2021*

This release brings a few features, and several improvements and bug fixes to the Hermes
relayer, notably the capability for Hermes to complete IBC connection handshakes when
it detects that one has been initialized, as well as the ability to detect chain
impersonation attacks and to dynamically estimate the gas needed to submit
a transaction.

Moreover, the overall reliability and availability of the relayer has also been improved
substantially by switching over to `tx_broadcast_sync` for submitting transactions.

### FEATURES

- [ibc-relayer-cli]
  - Add `--hd-path` option to `keys restore` and `keys add` commands to specify
    derivation path when importing keys ([#1049])

- [ibc-relayer]

## v0.4.0
*June 3rd, 2021*

- This release of Hermes features an internal [telemetry service][telemetry]
  which can export metrics about the relayer to Prometheus.
- A new [relaying strategy][strategy] is now available, which enables Hermes to
  complete channel handshakes in an event-based fashion.
- Hermes now checks if another relayer may have already processed a packet event,
  and will not attempt to process it itself, which improves performance.
- The startup time of the relayer has been substantially improved.
- The `start-multi` command has been promoted to `start`, which means
  that the worker-based relayer is not experimental anymore.
- A regression where Hermes would not recover after a node went down and up again was fixed.

## 0.0.1

*July 1st, 2020*

This is the initial prototype release of an IBC relayer and TLA+ specifications.
There are no compatibility guarantees until v0.1.0.

Includes:

- Configuration file definition and validation
- Client state, consensus state, connection, channel queries.
    - Note: deserialization is unimplemented as it has dependency on migration to protobuf for ABCI queries
- Per chain light clients threads are created and headers are periodically retrieved and verified.
- Per chain IBC event monitor threads are spawned and main event handler that receives them.
    - Note: the event handler just displays the events.
- IBC Modules partial implementation for datastructures, messages and queries.
- Some English and TLA+ specifications for Connection & Channel Handshake as well as naive relayer algorithm.

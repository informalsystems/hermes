# Start the local chains

To start the local chains, open a terminal and navigate to the `ibc-rs` repository folder

```bash
cd ibc-rs
```

### Stop existing `gaiad` processes

If this is not the first time you are running the script, you can manually stop the two gaia instances executing the following command to kill all `gaiad` processes:

```shell
killall gaiad
```

> __NOTE__: If you have any `Docker` containers running that might be using the same ports as `gaiad` (e.g. port 26657 or port 9090), please ensure you stop them first before proceeding to the next step.

### Configuration file

In order to run the script, you will need a `TOML` configuration file to be passed as a parameter. Please check the [`Configuration`](./config.md) section for more information about the relayer configuration file.

The following configuration file in the `ibc-rs` repository folder can be used for running the local chains:

__config.toml__

```toml
[global]
timeout = '10s'
strategy = 'naive'
log_level = 'error'

[[chains]]
id = 'ibc-0'
rpc_addr = 'tcp://localhost:26657'
grpc_addr = 'tcp://localhost:9090'
account_prefix = 'cosmos'
key_name = 'testkey'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas = 3000000
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'

[chains.trust_threshold]
numerator = '1'
denominator = '3'

[[chains]]
id = 'ibc-1'
rpc_addr = 'tcp://localhost:26557'
grpc_addr = 'tcp://localhost:9091'
account_prefix = 'cosmos'
key_name = 'testkey'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas = 3000000
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'

[chains.trust_threshold]
numerator = '1'
denominator = '3'
```

#### Saving the configuration file

##### Create the config.toml file

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/.hermes && touch $HOME/.hermes/config.toml
```

##### Add content to the configuration file:

You can use your preferred text editor. If using `vi` you can run:

```shell
vi ~/.hermes/config.toml
```

Then just __`copy`__ the content for `config.toml` above and __`paste`__ into this file.

### Running the script to start the chains

From the `ibc-rs` repository folder run the following script with the parameters below to start the chains (`ibc-0` and `ibc-1`) and configure the light client peers:

```bash
./scripts/dev-env ~/.hermes/config.toml ibc-0 ibc-1
```

> __NOTE__: If the script above prompts you to delete the data folder just answer __'yes'__

The script configures and starts two __`gaiad`__ instances, one named __`ibc-0`__ and the other __`ibc-1`__

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[dev-env] -->|run| C(start chains)
    C -->|gaiad| D[ibc-0]
    C -->|gaiad| F[ibc-1]
```

If the script runs successfully you should see a message similar to the one below in the terminal:

```shell

```

### Data directory
The script creates a __`data`__ directory in the current directory in order. The __`data`__ directory contains the chain stores and configuration files.

The __`data`__ directory has a tree structure similar to the one below:

```shell
data
├── ibc-0
│   ├── config
│   ├── data
│   ├── keyring-test
│   ├── key_seed.json
│   └── validator_seed.json
├── ibc-0.log
├── ibc-1
│   ├── config
│   ├── data
│   ├── keyring-test
│   ├── key_seed.json
│   └── validator_seed.json
└── ibc-1.log

```

### $HOME/.hermes directory

By the default `hermes` expects the configuration file to be in the __`$HOME/.hermes`__ folder. 

It also stores the private keys for each chain in this folder as outlined in the [Keys](./keys.md) section. 

After executing the __`dev-env`__ script, this is how the folder should look like:

```shell
$HOME/.hermes/
├── config.toml
└── keys
    ├── ibc-0
    │   └── keyring-test
    │       └── testkey.json
    └── ibc-1
        └── keyring-test
            └── testkey.json
```

#### Next Steps

We now offer two options with regard to connecting the two chains:

1. you can use [individual (raw) transactions](./tutorial_raw.html) to create 
   all the necessary chain objects (clients, connections, channels), or
2. you can perform this step using a 
   [simplified approach](./tutorial_relay_paths.html).

# Help

This section provides guidelines regarding troubleshooting and general 
resources for getting help with `hermes`.

### Troubleshooting
For troubleshooting, we recommend a few ideas that could be of help:

- [configure][config] the `log_level` so that the relayer will print
  more useful information that could help with debugging;
- consult the [list of reported issues][issues] and search by relevant keywords
  to see if you're dealing with a known problem;
- lastly, we would be grateful if you can submit a [bug report][bug-report]
  discussing any problem you find, and from there on we can look at the 
  problem together. 


### New Feature Request

If you would like a feature to be added to `hermes`, don't hesitate 
to open a discussion about that via the [feature request][feature-request]

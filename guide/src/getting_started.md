# Getting Started

In order to run Hermes, please make sure you have all the 
[pre-requisites](./pre_requisites.md) installed on your machine.

Once you have these pre-requisites, you can
[build and run Hermes](./installation.md).

> The instructions in this guide have been tested on `Linux` and `MacOS` 
> environments. Most of the commands should work on both environments. Even 
> though you can build and run the relayer on `Windows` (since we develop it 
> in Rust and it supports cross platform compilation) we have not tested the 
> relayer on `Windows` and we do not support this operating system at this time.

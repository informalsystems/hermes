# Getting Started

In order to run the relayer, please ensure you have all the [pre-requisites](./pre_requisites.md) installed on your machine.

Once you have all the pre-requisites installed on your machine, you can [build and run the relayer](./setup.md) in your machine.

> The instructions on this guide have been tested on `Linux` and `MacOS` environments. Most of the commands should work on both environments. Even though you can build and run the relayer on `Windows` (since we develop it in Rust and it supports cross platform compilation) we have not tested the relayer on `Windows` and we do not support this environment at this time.

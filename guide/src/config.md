# Configuration

In order to run Hermes, you will need to have a configuration file.

The format supported for the configuration file is [TOML](https://toml.io/en/).

By default, Hermes expects the configuration file to be located at `$HOME/.hermes/config.toml`.

This can be overridden by supplying the `-c` flag when invoking `hermes`, before the
name of the command to run, eg. `hermes -c my_config.toml query connection channels ibc-1 connection-1`.

> The current version of Hermes does not support managing the configuration file programmatically.
> You will need to use a text editor to create the file and add content to it.

```bash
hermes [-c CONFIG_FILE] COMMAND
```

## Sections

The configuration file must have one `global` section, and one `chains` section for each chain.

### `[global]`

The global section has parameters that apply globally to the relayer operation.

#### Parameters

* __strategy__: Specify the strategy to be used by the relayer. Currently only `naive` is supported.

* __log_level__: Specify the verbosity for the relayer logging output. Valid options are 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug', 'trace'. Default value is `info`.
For more information on parametrizing the log output, see the section
  [help/log-level][log-level].

Here is an example for the `global` section:

```toml
[global]
strategy = 'packets'
log_level = 'info'
```

### `[[chains]]`

A `chains` section includes parameters related to a chain and the full node to which the relayer can send transactions and queries.

#### Parameters

* __id__: Specify the chain ID. For example `ibc-0`

* __rpc_addr__: Specify the RPC address and port where the chain RPC server listens on. For example `http://localhost:26657`

* __grpc_addr__: Specify the GRPC address and port where the chain GRPC server listens on. For example `http://localhost:9090`

* __websocket_addr__: Specify the WebSocket address and port where the chain WebSocket server listens on. For example `ws://localhost:26657/websocket`

* __rpc_timeout__: Specify the maximum amount of time (duration) that the RPC requests should take before timing out. Default value is `10s` (10 seconds).

* __account_prefix__: Specify the prefix used by the chain. For example `cosmos`

* __key_name__: Specify the name of the private key JSON file. This is the filename for the private key used to sign transactions on this chain. Don't specify the file extension, for example if the filename for the private key is `testkey.json`, specify only `testkey` for this parameter.

* __store_prefix__: Specify the store prefix used by the on-chain IBC modules. For example `ibc`.

* __gas__: Specify the maximum amount of gas to be used as the gas limit for a transaction. Default value is `300000`

* __fee_denom__: Specify the denom to be used in the fee for a transaction.

* __fee_amount__: Specify the amount value to be used in the fee for a transaction. Default value is `1000`

* __clock_drift__: Specify the maximum amount of time to tolerate a clock drift. The clock drift parameter defines how much new (untrusted) header's Time can drift into the future. Default value is `5s`

* __trusting_period__: Specify the amount of time to be used as the trusting period. It should be significantly less than the unbonding period (e.g. unbonding period = 3 weeks, trusting period = 2 weeks). Default value is `14days` (336 hours)

For example if you want to add a configuration for a chain named `ibc-0`:

```toml
[[chains]]
id = 'ibc-0'
rpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:26657'
grpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:9090'
websocket_addr = 'ws://localhost:26657/websocket'
rpc_timeout = '10s'
account_prefix = 'cosmos'
key_name = 'testkey'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas = 200000
fee_denom = 'stake'
fee_amount = 10
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'
```

### Adding Private Keys

For each chain configured you need to add a private key for that chain in order to submit [transactions](./commands/raw/index.md), please refer to the [Keys](./commands/keys/index.md) sections in order to learn how to add the private keys that are used by the relayer.

### Example configuration file

Here is a full example of a configuration file with two chains configured:

```toml
[global]
strategy = 'packets'
log_level = 'error'

[[chains]]
id = 'ibc-0'
rpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:26657'
grpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:9090'
websocket_addr = 'ws://localhost:26657/websocket'
rpc_timeout = '10s'
account_prefix = 'cosmos'
key_name = 'testkey'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas = 200000
fee_denom = 'stake'
fee_amount = 10
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'

[chains.trust_threshold]
numerator = '1'
denominator = '3'

[[chains]]
id = 'ibc-1'
rpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:26557'
grpc_addr = 'http://127.0.0.1:9091'
websocket_addr = 'ws://localhost:26557/websocket'
rpc_timeout = '10s'
account_prefix = 'cosmos'
key_name = 'testkey'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas = 200000
fee_denom = 'stake'
fee_amount = 10
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'

[chains.trust_threshold]
numerator = '1'
denominator = '3'
```

### Next Steps

Now that you learned how to build the relayer and how to create a configuration file, you can go to the [`Two Chains`](./tutorials/local-chains/index.md) tutorial to learn how to perform some local testing connecting the relayer to two local chains.

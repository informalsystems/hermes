# Configuration

In order to run Hermes, you will need to have a configuration file.

The format supported for the configuration file is [TOML](https://toml.io/en/).

By default, Hermes expects the configuration file to be located at `$HOME/.hermes/config.toml`.

This can be overridden by supplying the `-c` flag when invoking `hermes`, before the
name of the command to run, eg. `hermes -c my_config.toml query connection channels ibc-1 connection-1`.

> The current version of Hermes does not support managing the configuration file programmatically.
> You will need to use a text editor to create the file and add content to it.

```bash
hermes [-c CONFIG_FILE] COMMAND
```

### Example configuration file

Here is a full example of a configuration file with two chains configured:

```toml
{{#include ../../config.toml}}
```

### Next Steps

Now that you learned how to build the relayer and how to create a configuration file, you can go to the [`Two Chains`](./tutorials/local-chains/index.md) tutorial to learn how to perform some local testing connecting the relayer to two local chains.

# Raw Transactions

There are a number of simple commands that perform minimal validation, build and send IBC transactions.

The `tx raw` command provides the following sub-commands:

| CLI name               | Description                                                                                                     |

| `chan-open-try`        | [Relay the channel attempt (ChannelOpenTry)](./channel-open.md#channel-open-try)                           |

| `ft-transfer`          | [Send a fungible token transfer test transaction (ICS20 MsgTransfer](./packet.md#fungible-token-transfer) |
| `packet-recv`          | [Relay receive or timeout packets](./packet.md#relay-receive-and-timeout-packets)                          |
| `packet-ack`           | [Relay acknowledgment packets](./packet.md#relay-acknowledgment-packets)                                   |

The main purpose of these commands is to support development and testing, and continuous integration. These CLIs take quite a few parameters and they are explained in the individual sub-sections.

At a high level, most commands follow this template:

```shell
hermes tx raw <ibc-datagram> <dst-chain-id> <src-chain-id> [-d <dst-obj-id> -s <src-obj-id>]*
```

In the command template above:

- `ibc-datagram` - identifies the "main" IBC message that is being sent, e.g. `conn-init`, `conn-try`, `chan-open-init`, etc. To ensure successful processing on the receiving chain, the majority of these commands build and send two messages: one `UpdateClient` message followed by the actual IBC message. These two messages are included in a single transaction. This is done for all IBC datagrams that include proofs collected from the source chain.

    The messages that do not require proofs are:
    - `MsgCreateClient` (`create-client` command),
    - `MsgConnectionOpenInit` (`conn-open-init` command),
    - `MsgChannelOpenInit` (`chan-open-init` command),
    - `MsgChannelCloseInit` (`chan-close-init` command) and
    - `MsgTransfer` (`ft-transfer` command)

- `dst-chain-id` - is the identifier of the chain where the transaction will be sent.

- `src-chain-id` - is the identifier of the chain that is queried for the data that is included in the transaction, e.g. connection data, client proofs, etc. To ensure correct on-chain state, the relayer also queries the destination chain, however it does not include this information in the Tx to the destination chain.

- `dst-obj-id` - the identifier of an object on destination chain required by the datagram, e.g. the `client-id` associated with the connection on destination chain in connection datagrams. Or the `connection-id` in a `ConnOpenAck` datagram.

- `src-obj-id` - the identifier of an object on the source chain, required by the datagram, e.d. the `client-id` of the connection on source chain.

- More details about the `tx raw` commands can be found in the following sections:
     - [Client](./client.md)
     - [Connection](./connection.md)
     - [Channel Open](./channel-open.md)
     - [Channel Close](./channel-close.md)
     - [Packet](./packet.md)

# Connecting the chains

In the rest of this section we will show how to create the clients, establish a connection and a channel between the two chains, and relay packets over the channel. But first, make sure you followed the steps in the [start the local chains](../start.md) and [Identifiers section](../identifiers.md)

## Steps to start relaying packets between the two local chains

In order to start relaying packets please follow the steps below:

* [Configure Clients](./client.md)
* [Connection Handshake](./connection.md)
* [Open the Channel](./channel.md)
* [Relay Packets](./packet.md)

# Tutorial: Relayer with two local chains

In this tutorial we will show how you can test the relayer against two chains using Gaiad manager `gm`. This is the easiest way to get started.

Using `gm` we will start two [`gaia`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia) chains that support the `IBC` protocol.

Follow the steps in this tutorial section starting with the [Install Gaia](./gaia.md) section.

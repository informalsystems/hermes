# Local chains

In this tutorial, you will test Hermes against two chains using Gaiad manager `gm`. This is the easiest way to get started.

Using `gm` you will start two [`gaia`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia) chains that support the `IBC` protocol.

Make sure that you followed the steps in the [Prerequisites for local chains](../pre-requisites/index.md) section before moving to the [next section](./start-local-chains.md).

# Production

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up Hermes to relay between the Cosmos Hub chain and the Osmosis chain.

You will monitor Hermes' activity with a [`Grafana dashboard`](https://grafana.com/) from which it is possible to visualize both the logs and the metrics produced by Hermes.

The [next section](./setup-grafana.md) will contain the steps to install all the dependencies of the monitoring platform.

# Build the topology

At this point in the tutorial, you should have four chains running and Hermes correctly configured. You can perform a `health-check` with the command :

```shell
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/health-check_1.md}}
```

If the command runs successfully, it should output something similar to:
```
    2022-08-23T15:54:58.150005Z  INFO ThreadId(01) using default configuration from '$HOME/.hermes/config.toml'

    SUCCESS performed health check for all chains in the config
```

In the following tutorial, we will connect all of these chains in a full mesh topology, then use `Packet filters` to simulate the topology given at the beginning of the [previous section](./start-local-chains.md).

> __NOTE__: It is also possible to only create the channels that you want. However, in production, anyone can open channels and recreate a fully-connected topology.

---

## Connect all the chains

Execute the following command:
```shell
{{#template ../../templates/commands/gm/hermes_cc.md}}
```

If this command runs successfully, it should output the following:

```shell
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/create/channel_2.md --yes BINARY="$HOME/ibc-rs/target/release/hermes" A_CHAIN_ID=ibc-0 B_CHAIN_ID=ibc-1 A_PORT_ID=transfer B_PORT_ID=transfer}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/create/channel_2.md --yes BINARY="$HOME/ibc-rs/target/release/hermes" A_CHAIN_ID=ibc-0 B_CHAIN_ID=ibc-2 A_PORT_ID=transfer B_PORT_ID=transfer}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/create/channel_2.md --yes BINARY="$HOME/ibc-rs/target/release/hermes" A_CHAIN_ID=ibc-0 B_CHAIN_ID=ibc-3 A_PORT_ID=transfer B_PORT_ID=transfer}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/create/channel_2.md --yes BINARY="$HOME/ibc-rs/target/release/hermes" A_CHAIN_ID=ibc-1 B_CHAIN_ID=ibc-2 A_PORT_ID=transfer B_PORT_ID=transfer}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/create/channel_2.md --yes BINARY="$HOME/ibc-rs/target/release/hermes" A_CHAIN_ID=ibc-1 B_CHAIN_ID=ibc-3 A_PORT_ID=transfer B_PORT_ID=transfer}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/create/channel_2.md --yes BINARY="$HOME/ibc-rs/target/release/hermes" A_CHAIN_ID=ibc-2 B_CHAIN_ID=ibc-3 A_PORT_ID=transfer B_PORT_ID=transfer}}
```

Executing these commands will:
* For every pair of chains, create a client on both chain tracking the state of the counterparty chain.
* Create a connection between these two clients.
* Create a `transfer` channel over this connection.

Use the flag `--exec` flag to execute these commands:

```shell
{{#template ../../templates/commands/gm/hermes_cc_exec.md}}
```

At this point, your network should be fully connected. It is now time to filter channels. The following chart shows the current state of the network. The channels that we want to filter out are filled in red while the channels we want to relay on are filled in green:

    class ibc3ibc0 allow;
    class ibc2ibc1 allow;
    class ibc1ibc2 allow;
    class ibc2ibc3 allow;
    class ibc3ibc2 allow;


    class ibc1ibc3 deny;
    class ibc3ibc1 deny;
    class ibc0ibc2 deny;
    class ibc2ibc0 deny;

    ibc0---ibc0ibc1---ibc1ibc0---ibc1
    ibc0---ibc0ibc2---ibc2ibc0---ibc2
    ibc0---ibc0ibc3---ibc3ibc0---ibc3
    ibc1---ibc1ibc2---ibc2ibc1---ibc2
    ibc1---ibc1ibc3---ibc3ibc1---ibc3
    ibc2---ibc2ibc3---ibc3ibc2---ibc3
```

You can verify that everything is correct with the commands:

```shell
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/query/channels_1.md OPTIONS= --show-counterparty CHAIN_ID=ibc-0}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/query/channels_1.md OPTIONS= --show-counterparty CHAIN_ID=ibc-1}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/query/channels_1.md OPTIONS= --show-counterparty CHAIN_ID=ibc-2}}
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/query/channels_1.md OPTIONS= --show-counterparty CHAIN_ID=ibc-3}}
```

Which should normally output: 

```
ibc-0: transfer/channel-0 --- ibc-1: transfer/channel-0
ibc-0: transfer/channel-1 --- ibc-2: transfer/channel-0
ibc-0: transfer/channel-2 --- ibc-3: transfer/channel-0

ibc-1: transfer/channel-0 --- ibc-0: transfer/channel-0
ibc-1: transfer/channel-1 --- ibc-2: transfer/channel-1
ibc-1: transfer/channel-2 --- ibc-3: transfer/channel-1

ibc-2: transfer/channel-0 --- ibc-0: transfer/channel-1
ibc-2: transfer/channel-1 --- ibc-1: transfer/channel-1
ibc-2: transfer/channel-2 --- ibc-3: transfer/channel-2

ibc-3: transfer/channel-0 --- ibc-0: transfer/channel-2
ibc-3: transfer/channel-1 --- ibc-1: transfer/channel-2
ibc-3: transfer/channel-2 --- ibc-2: transfer/channel-2
```

## Add packet filters

Let's use packet filters to relay only on the green paths specified in the chart. In order to add filters, open your default configuration file `$HOME/.hermes/config.toml` and add:
- Under `ibc-0`'s config: 
    ```
    [chains.packet_filter]
    policy = 'allow'
    list = [
        ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
        ['transfer', 'channel-2'],
    ]
    ```
- Under `ibc-1`'s config:
    ```
    [chains.packet_filter]
    policy = 'allow'
    list = [
        ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
        ['transfer', 'channel-1'],
    ]
    ```
- Under `ibc-2`'s config:
    ```
    [chains.packet_filter]
    policy = 'allow'
    list = [
        ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
        ['transfer', 'channel-2'],
    ]
    ```
- Under `ibc-3`'s config:
    ```
    [chains.packet_filter]
    policy = 'allow'
    list = [
        ['transfer', 'channel-0'],
        ['transfer', 'channel-2'],
    ]
    ```

> __NOTE__: It is also possible to use a `deny` policy to filter out the channels you do not want to relay on. However, if other channels exist or are created, Hermes will also relay on them.

At this point, your config file should look like this:
<details><summary style="font-weight:bold">config.toml</summary>

```
{{#include ../../templates/files/hermes/more-chains/config_with_filters.toml}}
```

</details>

It is also possible to check that the configuration file is valid with the command:

```shell
{{#template ../../templates/commands/hermes/config/validate_1.md}}
```

If the command runs successfully, the output should be:

```
SUCCESS "configuration is valid"
```

## Next Steps

The [following section](./start-relaying.md) describes how to relay packets between any chain with this topology.

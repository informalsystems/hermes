# Testing Client Upgrade

## Prerequisites

- Gaiad `(v7.0.*)`, for example:

```shell
gaiad version --log_level error --long | head -n4
```

## Testing procedure

### Setup using Gaia manager
> Note: The `gm.toml` file that we're using here looks like this:
```
[global]
  add_to_hermes = true
  auto_maintain_config = true
  extra_wallets = 2
  gaiad_binary = "$GOPATH/bin/gaiad"
  hdpath = ""
  home_dir = "$HOME/.gm"
  ports_start_at = 27040
  validator_mnemonic = ""
  wallet_mnemonic = ""

  [global.hermes]
    binary = "<path/to/hermes>"
    config = "$HOME/.hermes/config.toml"
    log_level = "info"
    telemetry_enabled = true
    telemetry_host = "127.0.0.1"
    telemetry_port = 3001

[ibc-0]
  ports_start_at = 27000

[ibc-1]
  ports_start_at = 27010
```
* Run the command `{{#template ../../../templates/commands/gm/start.md}}`
* Go to the file `$HOME/.gm/ibc-0/config/genesis.json` and change `max_deposit_period` and `voting_period` to a lower value, such as 120s
* Run the commands: `{{#template ../../../templates/commands/gm/reset.md}}`, `{{#template ../../../templates/commands/gm/hermes_config.md}}` and `{{#template ../../../templates/commands/gm/hermes_keys.md}}`

### Test upgrading chain and client

1. Create one client on `ibc-1` for `ibc-0`:

    ```shell
    {{#template ../../../templates/commands/hermes/create/client_1.md HOST_CHAIN_ID=ibc-1 REFERENCE_CHAIN_ID=ibc-0}}
    ```

    ```json
    Success: CreateClient(
       CreateClient(
           Attributes {
               height: Height { revision: 1, height: 9 },
               client_id: ClientId(
                   "07-tendermint-0",
               ),
               client_type: Tendermint,
               consensus_height: Height { revision: 0, height: 18 },
           },
       ),
    )
    ```

2. Create and submit an upgrade plan for chain `ibc-0`:

    Use test command to make an upgrade proposal. In the example below a software upgrade proposal is made for `ibc-0`, for the height `300` blocks from the latest height. `10000000stake` is deposited.
    The proposal includes the upgraded client state constructed from the state of `07-tendermint-0` client on `ibc-1` that was created in the previous step.

    ```shell
    {{#template ../../../templates/commands/hermes/tx/upgrade-chain_1.md REFERENCE_CHAIN_ID=ibc-0 HOST_CHAIN_ID=ibc-1 HOST_CLIENT_ID=07-tendermint-0 AMOUNT=10000000 HEIGHT_OFFSET=60}}
    ```

    ```text
    Success: transaction::Hash(CE98D8D98091BA8016BD852D18056E54C4CB3C4525E7F40DD3C40B4FD0F2482B)
    ```

 3. Verify that the proposal was accepted by querying the upgrade plan to check that it was submitted correctly.

     > Note: You can find the RPC port used to query the local node by running
     > `gm ports` in order to see a list of the ports being used.

    ```shell
    gaiad --node tcp://localhost:27000 query gov proposal 1 --home $HOME/.gm/ibc-0/
    ```

    If successful, you should see output like this. Note that the status of the proposal near the bottom of the output should be
    `PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD` indicating that the voting period is still ongoing.

    ```

 4. Vote on the proposal

    The parameter `1` should match the `proposal_id:` from the upgrade proposal submitted at step 3.
    This command must be issued while the proposal status is `PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD`. Confirm transaction when prompted.

    ```shell
    gaiad --node tcp://localhost:27000 tx gov vote 1 yes --home $HOME/.gm/ibc-0/data/ --keyring-backend test --keyring-dir $HOME/.gm/ibc-0/ --chain-id ibc-0 --from validator
    ```

    ```text
    confirm transaction before signing and broadcasting [y/N]: y

    txhash: 50CC1C39FBB14F99580A916ADE7F02883FFCC35D7862153F16BE86138151E17C
    ```

5. Test the `upgrade client` CLI

    The following command waits for the reference chain `ibc-0` to halt and then performs the upgrade for client `07-tendermint-0` on `ibc-1`. It outputs two events, one for the updated client state,
    and another for the upgraded state.
    The `--upgrade-height 65` value is taken from the `height` in the upgrade plan output.

    ```shell
    {{#template ../../../templates/commands/hermes/upgrade/client_1.md HOST_CHAIN_ID=ibc-1 CLIENT_ID=07-tendermint-0 REFERENCE_UPGRADE_HEIGHT=65}}
    ```
    ```json
    Success: [
        UpdateClient(
            h: 1-68, cs_h: 07-tendermint-0(0-65),
        ),
        UpgradeClient(
            UpgradeClient(
                Attributes {
                    height: Height {
                        revision: 1,
                        height: 68,
                    },
                    client_id: ClientId(
                        "07-tendermint-0",
                    ),
                    client_type: Tendermint,
                    consensus_height: Height {
                        revision: 0,
                        height: 66,
                    },
                },
            ),
        ),
    ]
    ```

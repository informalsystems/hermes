# TLA+ specification of the IBC Core protocols

A TLA+ specification of the IBC Core protocols ([ICS02](), [ICS03](), [ICS04](), [ICS18]()).
In particular, the main module is [IBCCore.tla](IBCCore.tla) and models the 
system consisting of two chains and two relayers. 
The model allows to express concurrency aspects of a system with multiple (correct) relayers.
The specification is written in a modular way, in order to facilitate future 
formal verification of properties and invariants in an adversarial setting.

## Modules

The specification has the following modules: 
  - `IBCCore.tla` (the main module)
  - `ICS18Relayer.tla` 
  - `Chain.tla`
  - `ICS02ClientHandlers.tla`
  - `ICS03ConnectionHandlers.tla`
  - `ICS04ChannelHandlers.tla`
  - `ICS04PacketHandlers.tla`
  - `IBCCoreDefinitions.tla`

### [`ICS18Relayer.tla`](ICS18Relayer.tla)
A relayer relays datagrams between the two chains. Its transition relation is defined by the formula:
```tla
Next ==
    \/ UpdateClient
    \/ CreateDatagrams
    \/ UNCHANGED vars    
```
where `UpdateClient` and `CreateDatagrams` are scheduled non-deterministically. 
`UpdateClient` picks a light client on the relayer for some chain and updates it. `CreateDatagrams` picks a direction (a pair of source and destination chain) and 
creates client, connection, channel, and packet datagrams (i.e., it captures the 
logic of [`pendingDatagrams()`](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-018-relayer-algorithms#pending-datagrams)).

### [`Chain.tla`](Chain.tla)
The chain state is represented by a chain store, which is a snapshot of the provable and private stores, to the extent necessary for IBC. Additionally, a chain has dedicated 
datagram containers for: 
1. client, connection, and channel datagrams (given by a set of datagrams),
2. packet datagrams (given by a queue of datagrams that models the order in which the datagrams were submitted by the relayer).

Its transition relation is defined by the formula:
```tla
Next ==
    \/ AdvanceChain 
    \/ HandleIncomingDatagrams
    \/ SendPacket
    \/ AcknowledgePacket
    \/ UNCHANGED vars
```
where:
- `AdvanceChain`: increments the height of the chain,
- `HandleIncomingDatagrams`: dispatches the datagrams to the appropriate handlers. 
This captures the logic of the [routing module](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-026-routing-module).
- `SendPacket`: models user/application-defined calls to send a packet. As this specification does not have a specific application in mind, we abstract away from the packet data, and allow sending packets non-deterministically. 
The packet commitment is written in the chain store, and the sent packet is logged, 
which triggers the relayer to create a `PacketRecv` datagram.
- `AcknowledgePacket`: writes an acknowledgement for a received packet
  in the chain store and on the packet log, which triggers the relayer to create a `PacketAck` datagram.

### [`ICS02ClientHandlers.tla`](ICS02ClientHandlers.tla), [`ICS03ConnectionHandlers.tla`](ICS03ConnectionHandlers.tla), [`ICS04ChannelHandlers.tla`](ICS04ChannelHandlers.tla), [`ICS04PacketHandlers.tla`](ICS04PacketHandlers.tla)
These TLA+ modules contain definitions of 
operators that handle client, connection handshake, channel handshake, and packet 
datagrams, respectively.
These operators capture the logic of the handlers defined in [ICS02](), [ICS03](), and 
[ICS04]().





The module `Relayer.tla` contains the specification of the relayer algorithm. 
The module `Chain.tla` captures the chain logic. 
It extends the modules `ClientHandlers.tla`, 
`ConnectionHandlers.tla`, `ChannelHandlers.tla`, and
`PacketHandlers.tla`, which contain definition of 
operators that handle client, connection handshake, channel handshake, and packet 
datagrams, respectively.
The module `RelayerDefinitions.tla` contains definition of operators that are used across all the 
modules.

## Properties and Invariants

### System-level properties

We specify three kinds of properties for the IBC core protocols:

- **IBCSafety**: Bad datagrams are not used to update the chain stores.

- **IBCValidity**: If `ChainB` receives a datagram from `ChainA`, then the datagram was sent by `ChainA` 

- **IBCDelivery**: If `ChainA` sends a datagram to `ChainB`, then `ChainB` eventually receives the datagram

TODO: add links to where they are

### Packet

ICS 04 specifies the following list of  ["Desired
Properties"](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#desired-properties)

#### [Efficiency](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#efficiency)

Efficiency seems to be too vague to formalize. In particular the
formulation ignores relayers that are the active components in packet
transmission. It is not clear what a suitable way is to formalize it
  
#### [Exactly-once delivery](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#exactly-once-delivery)

These properties are also vague as:

* in the absence of a relayer no packets can be delivered
* ignores timeouts
* unspecific what "sent" means. We suggest it means that a packet
      datagram is put wherever (TODO: Ilina please help) rather than
      executing `SendPacket`

As a result we suggest that the property should be decomposed into to properties:

* (at most once) if a valid chain delivers packet p, it will
		  not deliver packet p again in the future

* (typical case) If
  * sender and receiver chain are valid, and
  * there is a correct relayer, and 
  * communication is bounded in time, and
  * the timeoutheights and times are luckily chosen, and 
  * the receiver chain does not censor the packet, and
  * ...  

  then the packet will be delivered.


The second property ignores that timeouts can happen.


#### [Ordering](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#ordering)

- ordered channels: It is not clear what "if packet x is sent before packet y by a channel end on chain A" meant in a context where chain A performs invalid transitions: then a packet with sequence number *i* can be sent after *i+1*. If this happens, the IBC implementation may be broken (depends on the relayer).

We thus formalize it in the context of two valid chains.

- no property defined for unordered.

#### [Permissioning](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#permissioning)

I guess we can formalize it as constraints about parameters and data when send is called. TODO with Ilina.



### Channel 

As there are no explicit properties regarding channels given in [ICS 04](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics) in textual form, we have formalized that the channel handshake does not deviate from the channel lifecycle provided as a [figure](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#channel-lifecycle-management). They are given in TODO under the names TODO

### Connection Handshake
We formalize [these properties](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/tree/master/spec/ics-003-connection-semantics#properties--invariants) as follows:
> Connection identifiers are first-come-first-serve: once a connection has been negotiated, a unique identifier pair exists between two chains.

[ICS3-Proto-1-ConnectionUniqueness](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/master/docs/spec/connection-handshake/L1_2.md#guarantees) A module accepts (i.e., initializes on) a connection end at most once.

>  The connection handshake cannot be man-in-the-middled by another blockchain's IBC handler.



## Invariants TODO: Find a place for this section

To check invariants with [Apalache](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/), we introduce a history variable, which keeps track of the state of the connections 
and channels.
We define the invariant **IBCInv**, which states that 
once a connection or channel end reaches a certain state, 
it does not go back to the previous state. 

For example, if the connection end on `ChainA` has 
reached state `OPEN`, it never goes back to the state `UNINIT`.


## Using the Model

### Constants

The module `ICS18Environment.tla` is parameterized by the constants:
 - `ClientDatagramsRelayer_i`, for `i in {1, 2}`, a Boolean flag defining if `Relayer_i` creates client datagrams, 
 - `ConnectionDatagramsRelayer_i`, for `i in {1, 2}`, a Boolean flag defining if `Relayer_i` creates connection datagrams,
 - `ChannelDatagramsRelayer_i`, for `i in {1, 2}`, a Boolean flag defining if `Relayer_i` creates channel datagrams,
 - `MaxHeight`, a natural number denoting the maximal height of the chains,
 - `MaxPacketSeq`, a natural number denoting the maximal packet sequence number,
 - `ChannelOrdering`, a string indicating whether the channels are ordered or unordered 


## Importing the specification into TLA+ toolbox

To import the specification in the TLA+ toolbox and run TLC:
  - add a new spec in TLA+ toolbox with the root-module file `ICS18Environment.tla` 
  - create a model
  - assign a value to the constants
  - choose "Temporal formula" as the behavior spec, and use the formula `Spec`
  - add the properties `ICS18Safety` and `ICS18Delivery`
  - run TLC on the model
  
#### Assigning values to the constants in a TLC model

The Boolean flags, defined as constants in the module `ICS18Environment.tla`, allow us to run experiments in different settings. For example, if we set both `ClientDatagramsRelayer_1` and `ClientDatagramsRelayer_2` to `TRUE` in a TLC model, then the two relayers in the system concurrently create datagrams related to client creation and client update, and the model checker will check the temporal properties related to client datagrams. 

Observe that the setting where, for example,  `ClientDatagramsRelayer_1 = TRUE`, `ConnectionDatagramsRelayer_2 = TRUE`, `ChannelDatagramsRelayer_1 = TRUE`, and the remaining flags are `FALSE`, is equivalent to  a single relayer, as there is no concurrency in the creation of datagrams between the two relayers. 

## Checking the invariant `ICS18Inv` with Apalache

To check the `ICS18Environment.tla` specification with [Apalache](https://github.com/informalsystems/apalache/), we use the file `ICS18Environment_apalache`, where we define the values of the model constants. To run the model checker and check the invariant `ICS18Inv`, we run the command:
```shell
apalache check --inv=ICS18Inv ICS18Environment_apalache.tla
```

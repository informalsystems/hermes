/**
    A driver for interacting with a chain full nodes through command line.

    The name `ChainDriver` is inspired by
    [WebDriver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver),
    which is the term used to describe programs that control spawning of the
    web browsers. In our case, the ChainDriver is used to spawn and manage
    chain full nodes.

    Currently the `ChainDriver` is hardcoded to support only a single version
    of Gaia chain. In the future, we will want to turn this into one or more
    `ChainDriver` traits so that they can be used to spawn multiple chain
    implementations other than a single version of Gaia.

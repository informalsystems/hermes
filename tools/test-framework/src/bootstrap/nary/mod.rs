/*!
   Experimental work to bootstrap N-ary chains for testing.

   This is a work in progress and although it works, is currently
   lack of documentation. We put this behind the "experimental"
   feature flag so that developers who do not need this feature
   are not obligated to go though the code and understand what
   is happening under the hood.

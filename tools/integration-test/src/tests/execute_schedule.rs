//! This test ensures that the `RelayPath::execute_schedule` method does not
//! drop any scheduled `OperationalData` when events associated with a prior
//! piece of operational data fails to send. Subsequent pieces of operational
//! data that were scheduled should be re-queued and not dropped.
//!
//! In order to test this behavior, the test manually relays a batch (i.e. at least
//! 2) IBC transfers from chain A to chain B. Chain B is then shut down in order to
//! force the batch of messages (in the form of their associated pieces of operational
//! data) to be queued up again for re-submission.
//!
//! It is expected that the first message of the batch gets dropped (i.e. it is not
//! later found in the pending queue), but all of the subsequent messages should
//! exist in the pending queue.

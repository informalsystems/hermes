# ibc-rs

> Rust implementation of IBC modules and relayer

## Disclaimer

THIS PROJECT IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT IN A WORKING STAGE NOW, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.42+ (might work on earlier versions but this has not been tested yet)

## Usage

Provided that one has a Tendermint node running on port 26657, one can
configure and spawn two light clients for this chain with the following commands (to be run in the `ibc-rs` directory):

1. Fetch a trusted header from the chain:

    ```bash
    $ curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.sync_info|.latest_block_hash,.latest_block_height'
    ```

2. Initialize a light client for chain A with the trusted height and hash fetched in step 1:

    ```bash
    ibc-rs $ cargo run --bin relayer -- -c ./relayer/relay/tests/config/fixtures/relayer_conf_example.toml light init -x HASH -h HEIGHT chain_A
    ```
    > Replace `HASH` and `HEIGHT` with the appropriate values.

3. Repeat step 1 and 2 above for `chain_B`.

    > For this, update the height and hash, and change the chain identifier in the command above from `chain_A` to `chain_B`.

4. Start the light clients and a dummy relayer thread:

    ```bash
    ibc-rs $ cargo run --bin relayer -- -c ./relayer/relay/tests/config/fixtures/relayer_conf_example.toml run
    ```

**Note:** Add a `-v` flag to the commands above to see detailed log output, eg. `cargo run --bin relayer -- -v -c ./relayer/relay/tests/config/fixtures/relayer_conf_example.toml run`

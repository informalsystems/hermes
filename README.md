# ibc-rs

Rust implementation of Interblockchain Communication (IBC) 
[modules](/modules) and 
[relayer](/relayer).

Includes [TLA+ specifications](/docs/spec).

## Disclaimer

THIS PROJECT IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT IN A WORKING STAGE NOW, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Releases

This project is still a pre v0.1.0 prototype. Releases can be found
[here](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/releases)

## Installation 

Requires Rust 1.42+ (might work on earlier versions but this has not been tested yet)

These are instructions for setting up a local development environment with two
IBC-enabled local blockchains that the relayer can run against.

### Using Docker
For alternative setup using scripts, check the next section.
```shell script
docker run --rm -d -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 informaldev/chain_a
docker run --rm -d -p 26556:26656 -p 26557:26657 informaldev/chain_b
```

### Using scripts
Dependencies:

- `jq`, a command-line JSON processor
- [`gaia`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), a blockchain supporting IBC 

Clone the relayer implementation from [iqlusioninc/relayer](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/relayer/).
We are interested in two commands we can run from this repo:

- `bash scripts/two-chainz "local" "skip"`. Running this script will instantiate two chains, listening on ports `26557` and `26657`, respectively.


- `bash dev-env`. Running this script from your local source instantiates two chains, on ports `26557` and `26657`, and starts a relayer that sets up one connection, one channel and sends a few packets over the channel.

Note that these script rely on the [cosmos/gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia) implementation, which is a Cosmos-SDK application for the cosmos hub. 

## Running the Relayer

Assuming two Tendermint nodes running on local ports `26557` and `26657`.
Suppose we use the name `chain_A` to refer to the node running on port `26657`, and the name `chain_B` for the node running on port `26557`.
We can now configure and spawn two light clients for each of these chains with the following sequence of commands.
Run these from the `ibc-rs` directory:

1. Fetch a trusted header from `chain_A`:

    ```bash
    $ curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq '.result.sync_info|.latest_block_hash,.latest_block_height'
    ```

This should return two lines, the first one containing a hash, and the second containig the height of the chain running on `localhost:26657`.
Sample output:

```bash
"A8B490542710082377109F4B23E966F9AF924C90A4C3591E9DE9984FFABC2786"
"158"
```

2. Initialize a light client for `chain_A` with the trusted height and hash fetched in step 1:
    
    > Replace `HASH` and `HEIGHT` with the appropriate values (from step 1 above) in the following command.

    ```bash
    ibc-rs $ cargo run --bin relayer -- -c ./relayer/tests/config/fixtures/relayer_conf_example.toml light init -x HASH -h HEIGHT chain_A
    ```

3. Repeat step 1 and 2 above for `chain_B`.

    > For this, update the height and hash, and change the chain identifier in the command above from `chain_A` to `chain_B`.

4. Finally, start the main relayer thread, along with the light clients and IBC event monitor threads:

    ```bash
    ibc-rs $ cargo run --bin relayer -- -c ./relayer/tests/config/fixtures/relayer_conf_example.toml start --reset
    ```

    The `--reset` flag only needs to be passed once, for initializing the trusted headers based on the hash & height stored from steps 1-3 above.

Beside the basic relayer `start` command, the following are also available:

- `listen` will start only the monitor part of the relayer, without the light client functionality;
- `query`can be used to initiate various queries against one of the chains, for example: `cargo run --bin relayer -- -v -c ./relayer/tests/config/fixtures/relayer_conf_example.toml query connection end chain_A testconnection` will look up the connection with identifier `testconnection` on chain `chain_A`.
Note: Currently these commands fail in the response deserialization code and will be fixed as soon as  the protobuf encoding is available for tendermint and cosmos-sdk implementations.

The `relayer-cli/src/commands.rs` file contains further description of the CLI subcommands.

**Note:** Add a `-v` flag to the commands above to see detailed log output, eg. `cargo run --bin relayer -- -v -c ./relayer/tests/config/fixtures/relayer_conf_example.toml run`

## Contributing

IBC is specified in English in the [cosmos/ics repo](https://github.com/cosmos/ics). Any
protocol changes or clarifications should be contributed there.

This repo contains the TLA+ specification and Rust implementation for the IBC
modules and relayer. If you're interested in contributing, please comment on an issue or open a new
one!

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), but none of the APIs are stable yet. Expect
anything to break with each release until `v0.1.0`.

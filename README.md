Rust implementation of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

This project consists of the following crates:
 
 - The [`ibc`](https://docs.rs/ibc) crate defines the main data structures and on-chain logic  for the IBC protocol.
- The [`ibc-relayer`](https://docs.rs/ibc-relayer) crate provides an implementation of an IBC relayer, as a library.
- [`hermes`](https://hermes.informal.systems) is a command-line interface for the IBC relayer provided by this project.

See the table below for details.

Includes [TLA+ specifications](/docs/spec).

> TODO: update the crate and docs links below (for relayer and relayer-cli).

## Requirements 

Developed with the latest stable version of Rust: `1.49.0`. 
(May work with older versions.)

## Relayer guide

The main relayer CLI binary, called `hermes`, has a comprehensive guide at
[hermes.informal.systems](http://hermes.informal.systems).

## Contributing

IBC is specified in English in the [cosmos/ics repo](https://github.com/cosmos/ics). Any
protocol changes or clarifications should be contributed there.

This repo contains the TLA+ specification and Rust implementation for the IBC
modules and relayer. If you're interested in contributing, please comment on an issue or open a new
one!

See also [CONTRIBUTING.MD](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), though APIs are still 
under active development.
